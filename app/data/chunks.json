This means that if the appeal is against an\ninterlocutory decision in a civil cause or matter, it must be filed within fourteen days from the date of the decision. This is also subject to the provisions of\nS. 25 where it is against a final decision of the court, then the appeal must be filed within three months from the date of the decision. It is also manifest that\nby virtue of subsection 4 of Section 25 of the Court of Appeal Act, it may extend the periods prescribed in subsections (2) & (3) of Section 25 of the Act.\"\nLAND LAW - LAND USE ACT, 1978 - Whether the Land Use Act prohibits some form of agreement to transfer or alienate land\n\"...His Lordship Uwaifo, JSC who delivered the lead judgment then observed on the above provisions of S. 22 of the Act, thus: - \"The position of S. 22 of the\nAct is clearly this: A holder of a right of occupancy may enter into an agreement or contract, with a view to alienating his said right of occupancy. To enter\ninto such an agreement or contract, he does not need the consent of the Governor. He merely operates within the first stage of a 'transfer on sale of an\nestate in land' which stage ends with the formation of a binding contract for a sale constituting an estate contract at best. But when he comes to embark\non the next stage of alienating or transferring his right of occupancy which is done by a conveyance or deed, culminating in vesting the said right in the\n'purchaser', he must obtain the consent of the Governor to make the transaction valid. If he fails to, then the transaction is null and void under S. 26 of the\nAct. In my view, it is necessary to bear these two stages clearly in mind.\" And continued by quoting with approval what this court said in Awojugbagbe Light\nIndustries Ltd. v. Chinukwe (supra) where Iguh, JSC, at pages 435-436 said: - \"I think it ought to be stressed that the holder of a statutory right of\noccupancy is certainly not prohibited by Section 22(1) of the Act from entering into some form of negotiations which may end with a written agreement for\npresentation to the Governor for his necessary consent or approval. This is because the Land Use Act does not prohibit a written agreement to transfer or\nalienate land. So long as such a written agreement is understood and entered into subject to the consent of the Governor, there will no contravention of\nSection 22(1) of the Land Use Act by the mere fact that such a written agreement is executed before it is forwarded to the Governor for his consent.\"\nLAND LAW - GOVERNOR'S CONSENT - Who has the duty of obtaining Governor's consent\n\"It is the owner of a statutory Certificate of Occupancy that is obliged to obtain the consent of the Governor of the State where the land in respect of\nwhich he wishes to sell, transfer or mortgage etc by virtue of S. 22 of the Land Use Act, and the relevant provisions of the Land Tenure Law of Northern\nNigeria.\"\nCOURT - POWER OF COURT - Whether the court has the power to make or rewrite a contract for the parties\n\"It is interesting that in the case of U.B.N. v. Ozigi (1994) 3 NWLR (Pt. 333) 385, a clause similar in material terms was inserted in the mortgage deed that had\nto be considered in determining the merits of that appeal. In the course of the consideration of the meaning and effect of that clause, it was observed as I\nhave done above that the court cannot make a contract for the parties or to rewrite the one they have made for themselves. Adio, JSC in that case then\nwent on to make the following observation:- \"In other words, the words in a document must first be given their simple and ordinary meaning and under no\ncircumstances may new or additional words be imported into the text unless the document would be by the absence of that which is imported impossible\nto understand. The presumption is that the parties have intended what they have in fact said so that their words must be construed as they stand . See\nSolicitor-General, Western Nigeria v. Adebonjojo (1971) 1 All NLR 178.\" And further on at page 405, His Lordship said thus:- \"The provision of clause 3 of the\nmortgage agreements is clear and unambiguous. It is possible to understand and apply it as it stands. There was, therefore, no necessity to import new or\nadditional words into it to require prior consultation with, or the giving of prior notice of increase in rates of interest on the loan in question to the\nrespondent. Therefore, failure of the appellant to hold prior consultation with or to give prior notice to the respondent about increase in rates of interest on\nthe loan could not, as the Court of Appeal held, result in the nullification of the interest rates stipulated under the provision of clause 3 of the mortgage\nagreements.\"\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/53\nMORTGAGE - MORTGAGED PROPERTY - Statutory definition of a mortgage\n\"A mortgage\", in any event, has been defined by Section 51(1) of the Land Use Act, Cap. 202, LFN. to include, \"a second and subsequent mortgage and\nequitable mortgage.\"\nEVIDENCE - BURDEN OF PROOF/ONUS OF PROOF - On whom lies the burden of proof in a claim\n\"In the first place, it is expected that the onus is on the appellant who initiated this claim to prove its case. That has always been the guiding principle in our\nlaw. See Okubule v. Oyagbola (1990) 4 NWLR (Pt.147) 723; Ike v. Ugboaja (1993) 6 NWLR (Pt.301) 539. I therefore do not see what evidence is required of the\nrespondent when the respondent has not been shown to have led evidence of a kind which shifted the onus of proof of a particular point to the\nrespondent.

(1991) 1 NWLR\n(Pt.167) 290\"\nJUDGEMENT SUMMARY\nINTRODUCTION:\nThis appeal centers on Mortgage.\nFACTS:\nThis is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Kaduna Division) wherein it reversed the judgment of the trial court. At the trial Court, the appellant commenced\nan action against the respondent for the following claims: The short facts of the case are that the appellant applied for a secured loan of N50,000.00. It used its landed property\nat Oja Iya, Taiwo Road, Ilorin, as collateral. A deed of mortgage was executed for this purpose with the Governor's consent. That is Exhibit 4. Later the loan was increased to\nN100,000.00 and another deed of mortgage was executed to reflect this amount, which deed was accordingly upstamped. It is Exhibit D1. Still later, \u00a0the loan was increased to\nN200,000.00. The same procedure was followed. The deed is Exhibit 5. The Governor's consent was not sought in respect of Exhibits D1 and 5. The respondent alleged that\nthe appellant failed to repay the loan together with the accrued interest in accordance with the terms of the agreement. It decided to exercise its power of sale of the property\nas provided under the deed of mortgage. The appellant on the other hand disputed it was owing. It alleged that it discovered several multiple debits of particular cheques which\nwhen sorted out would leave it with enormous credit balance. It also contended that the Governor's consent was not obtained for Exhibits D1 and 5 and that they were null and\nvoid as a result. It then argued that since Exhibit 4 has ceased to exist on the principle of merger, there was no valid mortgage upon which the power to sell its property could\nbe exercised by the respondent. Finally, it contended that even if there was a subsisting deed of mortgage, the originally agreed interest rate could not be increased by the\nrespondent and used to calculate its liability without both parties agreeing upon such an increase. It was on the basis of these contentions that the appellant brought action at\nthe High Court, Ilorin. At the end of trial, the learned trial Judge granted all the claims of the appellant. As the respondent was dissatisfied with the judgment of the High Court, it\nsuccessfully \u00a0appealed to the Court of Appeal. Being dissatisfied, the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.\nISSUES:\nThe appellant formulated seven (7) issues for determination and the \u00a0respondent adopted the issues as follows:\n1. Whether the court below was right to hold that additional grounds of appeal Nos. 10,11,12,13 & 14 filed before it were competent and arguable when the grounds were\nfiled in contravention of the rules of the court below.\n\u00a02. Whether the court below was right to have held that additional ground No.13 filed before it was competent when the ground concerned an interlocutory ruling\ndelivered more than 2 years before the ground was filed and no leave was sought nor obtained to argue same.\n3. Whether the court below was right to have held that the principles of merger, of mortgages was inapplicable to exhibits 4, 5 and D1 and whether the further holding\nthat the said exhibits were validly upstamped was not perverse.\n\u00a04. Whether the court below was right to have held that the respondent could exercise the right of an unpaid mortgage when it did not file a counterclaim nor made out\na case on the point.\n\u00a05. Whether the court below was right to have held that the respondent was entitled to vary the rate of interest chargeably and whether without evidence the court\ncould take judicial notice of the Central Bank monetary policy on which the parties did not join issue.\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n4/53\n\u00a06. Whether the court below was right to have found that the appellant was indebted to the respondent when there \u00a0was no counter-claim by the respondent and\nwhen the amount awarded to the respondent was never part of its claim at the trial.\n\u00a07. Whether the court below was right to have set aside the well considered judgment of the trial court on all the issues agitated and in particular the issue of multiple\nentries in the appellant's account when there was no credible evidence from the respondent on the point and whether the cost awarded was not excessive.\nDECISION/HELD:\nIn the final analysis, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.\nAKINTOLA OLUFEMI EJIWUNMI, J.S.C.\n(Delivering The Leading judgment):\nThe thrust of this appeal filed\nagainst the judgment of the Court of Appeal\n(Kaduna Division Coram, Ogebe, M. Mohammed\nand Muhammad, JJCA) was for the purpose of\noverturning the judgment of that court which had\nreversed the judgment of the trial Court. In that\nCourt, the appellant had commenced this action\nagainst the respondent for the following claims as\nper par. 32 of its further amended statement of\nclaim:\n\"(i) Declaration that the mortgages between the\nplaintiff and the defendant covering the plaintiff's\nproperty situate, lying and being at Taiwo Road,\nIlorin are illegal, unlawful, unenforceable and\nirregular.\n(ii) An order setting aside the mortgages.\n(iii) Alternatively, declaration that the defendant is\nnot entitled to sell any property of the plaintiff\nwithout complying with the Land Use Act and\nAuctioneers Law applicable to Kwara State.\n(iv) Declaration that the defendant is only entitled\nto charge on the plaintiff's account interest at the\nrate prevailing when facility was granted to the\nplaintiff.\n(v) Declaration that the debit balance in the\naccount of the plaintiff is not a true and accurate\nreflectionoftheindebtednessoftheplaintiffifany,\n5\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n5/53\nto the defendant.\n(vi) Injunction restraining the defendant by\nthemselves their agents, servants and or privies or\notherwise howsoever from selling the plaintiff's\nproperty pursuant to the said mortgages.\n(vii) Declaration that the deeds of mortgage\nregistered as No. 122/122/1 and 45/45/6\nrespectively have been discharged by their\nincorporation in the deed registered as No.\n94/94/8.\n(viii) An order directing the defendant to pay to the\nplaintiff the sum of N500,000.00 or any amount\nthe court may find the plaintiff entitled to recover\nfrom the defendant.\"\nFollowing further amended statement of claim filed\nby the appellant, the respondent also sought the\nleave of the court to file a further amended\nstatement of defence, but that application was\nrefused by the learned trial Judge. That refusal by\nthe learned trial Judge to grant the prayer of the\nrespondent became one of the grounds of appeal in\nthe appeal filed against the judgment of the trial\ncourt. The decision of the court below in that\nregard has also been the question in this appeal. It\nwill be considered later in this judgment under the\nappropriate issue raised thereon.\nI will now refer briefly to what transpired during\nthe trial of this matter in the High Court. The\nappellant called two witnesses namely, Isaiah\nAdeoti Adeniran a chartered accountant who gave\n6\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n6/53\nevidence as PW1 and the PW2 was Alhaji (Dr)\nAminu Ishola who described himself as the\nmanaging director of the appellant company. The\nrespondent as defendant, called one witness in the\nperson of Mr. Remi Okulaja, a staff of the\nrespondent company. During the course of the\nevidence of these witnesses, a number of\ndocuments were admitted as exhibits. The evidence\ngiven by these witnesses disclosed that the\nappellant has been the customer of the respondent\nfor some time. In 1973, the respondent granted\nthrough the appellant an overdraft facility in the\nsum of N50,000.00.The facility was increased in\n1976 to N100,000.00 and subsequently to\nN200,000.00. As collateral to the loan facility, the\nappellant mortgaged its property situate at Oja-Iya,\nTaiwo Road, Ilorin. Before then when the first loan\nfacility was made available to the appellant, it duly\nobtained the consent of the Kwara State Governor\nto mortgage the property to the respondent. There\nwas however a failure of repayment by the\nappellant of the facility granted. The respondent,\nsometime in 1988 made a demand for the\nrepayment. As the appellant did not comply, the\nrespondent then advertised for the sale of the\nmortgaged property. As a result of that action\ntaken by the respondent, the appellant sought to\nrestrain the respondent from selling the said\nproperty through a motion ex-parte . This was\ngranted by the learned trial Judge on the 22nd of\nApril, 1992. This was followed by the present\naction, which is now the subject of this appeal.\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n7/53\n7\nUpon those facts, the learned trial Judge after\nhearing addresses of Counsel appearing for the\nparties delivered a considered judgment by which\nhe granted all the claims of the appellant. As the\nrespondent was dissatisfied with the judgment of\nthe trial Court, it appealed to the Court below.\nPursuant thereto, several grounds of appeal were\nfiled. Following the hearing of the appeal, the Court\nbelow allowed the appeal and the judgment of the\ntrial Court was set aside. This appeal is from that\njudgment of the court below. Briefs of argument\nwere thereafter filed and exchanged. In the brief\nfiled on behalf of the appellant, the following seven\nissues were identified for the determination of the\nappeal. The respondent did not set down issues on\nits own, but adopted the issues set down in the\nappellant's brief. These are:\n\"1. Whether the Court below was right to hold that\nadditional grounds of appeal Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13 &\n14 filed before it were competent and arguable\nwhen the grounds were filed in contravention of the\nrules of the court below.\n2. Whether the Court below was right to have held\nthat additional ground No.13 filed before it was\ncompetent when the ground concerned an\ninterlocutory ruling delivered more than 2 years\nbefore the ground was filed and no leave was\nsought nor obtained to argue same.\n3. Whether the Court below was right to have held\nthat the principles of merger, of mortgages was\ninapplicable to Exhibits 4, 5 and D1 and whether\n8\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/53\nthe further holding that the said exhibits were\nvalidly upstamped was not perverse.\n4. Whether the Court below was right to have held\nthat the respondent could exercise the right of an\nunpaid mortgage when it did not file a counterclaim\nnor made out a case on the point.\n5. Whether the Court below was right to have held\nthat the respondent was entitled to vary the rate of\ninterest chargeably and whether without evidence\nthe court could take judicial notice of the Central\nBank monetary policy on which the parties did not\njoin issue.\n6. Whether the Court below was right to have found\nthat the appellant was indebted to the respondent\nwhen there was no counter-claim by the\nrespondent and when the amount awarded to the\nrespondent was never part of its claim at the trial.\n7. Whether the Court below was right to have set\naside the well considered judgment of the trial\nCourt on all the issues agitated and in particular the\nissue of multiple entries in the appellant's account\nwhen there was no credible evidence from the\nrespondent on the point and whether the cost\nawarded was not excessive.\"\nIssue 1\nI longer need to consider this issue as learned\nCounsel for the appellant withdrew the issue in the\ncourse of the hearing of the appeal.\nIssue 2\nThis issue raises the question as to whether the\n9\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/53\nadditional ground 13 was competent when the\nground concerned an interlocutory ruling for which\nleave was not first sought and obtained to argue\nsame. Briefly stated, the facts that led to this\nground arose from the refusal of the trial court to\nallow the respondent, who was the defendant at the\ntrial to file a further amended statement of defence\nafter it had granted a similar application to the\nplaintiff to file a further amended statement of\nclaim. The trial court duly delivered a ruling\ndisallowing the application of the\nrespondent/defendant. It is common ground that\nthe defendant/respondent did not appeal against\nthat ruling immediately, but did so in the appeal\nfiled against the judgment of the trial court.\nIt is therefore contended for the appellant that\nthe Court below was wrong to have overruled that\naspect of the objection raised to that ground of\nappeal that the failure to obtain the leave of the\ntrial court or the court below to argue the appeal\nwas a mere technicality. The premise of the\nargument of learned Counsel for the appellant that\nthe Court below was wrong, lies in the provisions of\nSection 221(i) of the 1979 Constitution and Section\n25 (2) of the Court of Appeal Act. In his reply for\nthe respondent, learned senior Counsel contends\nthat an appellant should not upon a mere\ntechnicality be denied the right to appeal against a\ndecision which the party appealing considered to be\nagainst his interest. He therefore urged that the\ncourt below was right to have concluded that that\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n10/53\nappeal was properly before it. I think the question\n10\nfor consideration is not whether the right to appeal\nto the Court below was denied to the appellant but\nwhether the appeal was properly before the Court\nin consonance with the provisions of Sections 220\nand 221(10) of the Constitution and Section 25 (2)\nof the Court of Appeal Act,1976. S.220(1)(b) of\nthe Constitution of 1979 provides for right of\nappeal as of right against interlocutory decision\nof the High Court. It provides thus:-\n\"An appeal shall be from decision of a High Court\nto the Court of Appeal as of right in the following\ncases:\n(a) XXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n(b) Where the ground of appeal involves question\nof law alone decision in any civil or criminal\nproceedings.\"\nBut where the ground of appeal is of fact or mixed\nlaw and fact, there can be no appeal as of right.\nThe appellant can only appeal with the leave of\neither the Court of Appeal or the High Court as the\nConstitution in Section 221(1) provides thus:\u00a0\n\"Subject to the provisions of Section 220 of this\nConstitution, an appeal shall lie from decision of a\nHigh Court to the Court of Appeal with the leave of\nthat High Court or the Court of Appeal.\"\nThe right to appeal from a High Court to the Court\nof Appeal is also governed by Section 222(b) of the\nConstitution, which says that:\n\"Shall be exercised in accordance with any Act of\nNational Assembly and rules of court for the time\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n11/53\nbeing in force regulating the powers, practice and\nprocedure of the Court of Appeal.\"\n11\nNow, it\u00a0is\u00a0manifest\u00a0that\u00a0whether\u00a0the\u00a0appeal\u00a0is\u00a0based\non\u00a0grounds\u00a0of\u00a0law\u00a0which\u00a0enables\u00a0the\u00a0appellant\u00a0to\nappeal\u00a0as\u00a0of\u00a0right\u00a0or\u00a0the\u00a0grounds\u00a0are\u00a0of\u00a0mixed\u00a0law\nand\u00a0fact,\u00a0the\u00a0appeal\u00a0must\u00a0be\u00a0filed\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0time\nstipulated\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0above\u00a0provisions\u00a0to\u00a0ground\u00a0the\nappeal.\u00a0This\u00a0means\u00a0that\u00a0if\u00a0the\u00a0appeal\u00a0is\u00a0against\u00a0an\ninterlocutory\u00a0decision\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0civil\u00a0cause\u00a0or\u00a0matter,\u00a0it\nmust\u00a0be\u00a0filed\u00a0within\u00a0fourteen\u00a0days\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0date\u00a0of\nthe\u00a0decision.\u00a0This\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0subject\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0provisions\u00a0of\nS.25\u00a0where\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0against\u00a0a\u00a0final\u00a0decision\u00a0of\u00a0the\ncourt,\u00a0then\u00a0the\u00a0appeal\u00a0must\u00a0be\u00a0filed\u00a0within\u00a0three\nmonths\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0date\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0decision.\u00a0It\u00a0is\u00a0also\nmanifest\u00a0that\u00a0by\u00a0virtue\u00a0of\u00a0\nsubsection\u00a04\u00a0of Section 25\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Court\u00a0of\u00a0Appeal\u00a0Act\n\u00a0may\u00a0extend\u00a0the\nperiods\u00a0prescribed\u00a0in\u00a0subsections\u00a0(2) &\n(3)\u00a0of Section\u00a025\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Act\n.\nIn respect of the issue as raised in this appeal, it is\ncommon ground that the appeal was against an\ninterlocutory decision of the High Court. It is also\ncommon ground that the appeal was not filed in\ncompliance with the above quoted provisions of the\nConstitution and subsections 2, 3 & 4 of Section 25\nof the Court of Appeal Act, 1976. The argument of\nSenior Advocate of Nigeria, that this Court had in a\nnumber of cases observed that the expeditious trial\nof cases should not be delayed on account of\ninterlocutory appeals is well taken. But that is not\nto say that if such appeals are to be heard with the\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/53\nmain appeal in respect of the case, the provisions\nof the Constitution and the law with regard to\n12\ninterlocutory appeals should not be complied with.\nIt is therefore my view that the observance of the\nlaw and the rules designated for appeals in respect\nof interlocutory appeals is not to be disregarded as\na mere technicality. As it is not in dispute that the\nappeal against the interlocutory decision of the\nHigh Court to the court below was not in\naccordance with the above quoted provisions of the\nConstitution and the law, the question raised in this\nissue is hereby resolved in favour of the appellant.\nIssues 3, 4 and 5 would be considered together in\nthis judgment. This is because the arguments of\ncounsel in respect of this matter are concerned with\nExhibits 4, D1 and 5, the deeds of legal mortgages\nexecuted by the appellant with the respondent and\nwhich led to this action. On this 3rd issue, learned\nCounsel for the appellant admitted that Exhibit 4 is\nthe deed of legal mortgage that was used to secure\nthe first loan of N50,000.00 from the respondent in\n1973, and the consent of the Governor was duly\nobtained in respect of that transaction. In 1976,\nthe appellant's overdraft facility was increased to\nthe sum of N100,00.00 and it was further increased\nto the sum of N200,000.00 upon the same property\nwith which the loan facility was first granted in\n1973. The subsequent facilities though secured on\nthe same property, deeds of legal mortgages were\nexecuted between the parties and marked as\nExhibits D1 and 5 respectively.\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/53\nIt is also common ground that no consent was\n13\nreceived from the Governor in respect of the last\ntwo transactions that resulted in Exhibits D1 and 5.\nBefore I consider what learned counsel conceives as\nthe resultant effects of these transactions, it must\nbe stated that the appellant commenced this action\nafter the mortgaged property situate and lying at\nOja-Iya Taiwo Road, Ilorin was advertised for sale\nby the respondent. Before the property was so\nadvertised, the respondent had written a letter\ndated 12/1/88 demanding the payment of the sum\nof N118,052.38 from the appellant. It was after the\nappellant had failed to respond to the letter of\ndemand, that the property was advertised for sale.\nNow upon those admitted facts, it is contended for\nthe appellant that there was a resultant merger of\nthe legal mortgage Exhibit D, with Exhibit 4 as it\nwas executed in respect of the same property. And\nthat Exhibit 5 also became merged with the earlier\nExhibits 4 and D1, which was also secured upon the\nsame property with which Exhibit 4 was secured.\nUpon this, the learned Counsel for the appellant,\nY.O. Alli, SAN submits in the appellant's brief thus:\n\"That under the equitable doctrine of merger,\nonce an earlier deed of legal mortgage is\nincorporated into a latter one, the former ceases to\nexist on its own and it is in fact discharged. This\nrule is commonsensical and logical. If this is not so,\nthere arises the incongruous position that there will\nexist on the same property between the same\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n14/53\nparties more than one valid deed of legal mortgage.\nThe law disavows this.\n14\nOn this point we pray this Court to be persuaded\nby the statement of claim on this point in\nparagraph 979 of Halsbury's Law of England 4th\nEdition to the effect that:\n'by taking or acquiring a security of higher\nnature in legal valuation than one he already\npossesses, a person merges and extinguishes his\nlegal remedies upon the inferior security or cause\nof action...'\nThis statement of the law should be preferred\nover the statement contained in paragraph 982 of\nthe same work which suggests the contrary of the\nabove.\"\nNow, before commenting on the above submissions\nmade for the appellant, I deem it necessary to\nobserve that I have searched in vain for where in\nHalsbury's Laws of England 4th Edition, from where\nthe above paragraphs were quoted. It would have\nbeen far more helpful if the references had included\nthe relevant volume of Halsbury. I will however\nexamine the principle of merger, as I deem\npertinent later in this judgment. Further support\nfor the position envisaged for the appellant by\nreference to the Property and Conveyance Act of\n1881, but again no reference was made to the\nparticular section of the Act that is in support of the\nproposition being made for the appellant by his\nlearned Senior Advocate, Y.O. Alli, Esq. Reference\nwas also made to Black's Law Dictionary for the\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/53\ndefinition of \"merger\" and also to Meggary & Wade\nLaw of Property, 4th Edition, pages 892-893.\n15\nBasing himself on the above submissions with\nregard to his perception about the \"principles of\nmerger\", learned Counsel for the appellant\ntherefore argued that since Exhibits \"4\" and \"D1\"\nhave been merged into Exhibit \"5\", they are no\nmore effectual nor effective. The quantum of the\nright of the respondent, he further argues, is only\ntraceable to Exhibit \"5\". And as Exhibit D1 which\nwas executed in 1976 was not made with the\nconsent of the Governor, it is unenforceable.\nSimilarly also, Exhibit 5 is not also enforceable\nagainst the appellant as it did not receive the\nconsent of the Governor as they are in breach of\nthe provisions of Section 22 of the Land Use Act,\n1978, or Section 27 of the Land Tenure Law. Exhibit\n4 is not also enforceable, having been merged with\nExhibits D1 and 5.\nIn conclusion, it is argued for the appellant that the\ncourt below was wrong to have held that it was the\nappellant who had the duty to ensure that Exhibits\n\"D1\" and \"5\" received the consent of the Governor.\nThe following cases were cited: Ibidapo v. Lufthansa\nAirlines (1997) 4 NWLR (Pt.498) 124; Lawal-Osula\nv. Lawal-Osula (1993) 2 NWLR (Pt.274) 158 at\n175-176; Savannah Bank (Nig.) Ltd. v. Ajilo (1989)\n1 NWLR (Pt.97) 305 at 326-327; Paul Dickson &\nAnor v. Solicitor General of Benue Plateau State\n(1974) 5 SC 21; Alhaji Labaran Nakyauta v. Alhaji\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/53\nMaikima (1977) 6 SC 51.\n16\nIn the respondent's brief, the first contention made\nfor the respondent is that there is no provision in\nthe Land Tenure Law and the Land Use Act which\nrequires that subsequent increases of overdraft\nfacilities in favour of a customer of a bank in the\nposition of the appellant must be with the consent\nof the Governor. It is his contention also that the\nconsent given by the Governor in respect of Exhibit\n4 remains valid and enforceable and that Exhibits\nD1 and 5 are also valid by virtue of the fact that\nthe further overdraft facilities granted to the\nappellant was made upon the same property for\nwhich the Governor had granted consent in Exhibit\n4. It is his further contention that the appellant\nwho had the onus to prove that the lack of consent\nof the Governor in respect of Exhibits D1 and 5\nvitiated the enforceability of the documents in\nrespect of loan transactions failed to discharge that\nonus. In support of that submission, he cited Are v.\nAdisa (1967) 1 All NLR 148; Aladegbemi v.\nFasanmade (1988) 3 NWLR (Pt.81) 129, (1988) 6\nSCNJ 103. The learned senior Counsel for the\nrespondent also urged the Court to hold that the\ncases cited by the appellant in support of the\nproposition that Exhibits 4, D1 and 5 are not\nenforceable due to lack of Governor's consent do\nnot support that contention. These cases are\nIbidapo v. Lufthansa (supra); Lawal-Osula v.\nLawal-Osula (supra); Paul Dickson v. Solicitor\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/53\nGeneral of Benue Plateau State (supra); Alhaji\nLabaran Nakyauta v. Alhaji Maikima (supra).\n17\nIn his final submission in this issue. it is argued for\nthe respondent that equity will not aid an appellant\nas in this case who has derived benefit from a\ntransaction and that it is unconscionable for him to\nnow seek to avoid the liability that flowed from it.\nAnd he cited the following cases:- Adimora v. Ajufo\n(1988) 3 NWLR (Pt.80) 1, (1988) 6SCNJ 18; AP\nLtd. v. Owodunni (1991) 8 NWLR (Pt.210) 391;\nOwosho v. Dada (1984) 7 SC 149 at 174,\nAwojugbagbe Light Industries Ltd. v. Chinukwe\n(1995) 4 NWLR (Pt.390) 379. I think that the\nquestion that should first be considered in respect\nof this issue is with regard to what is expected of a\nholder of a statutory right of occupancy in terms of\nthe provisions of Section 27 of the Land Tenure Law\nCap.59 and Section 18(1) of the Land Registration\nLaw, Cap. 58, Laws of Northern Nigeria, 1963\napplicable at the time of the transactions in Kwara\nState in respect of Exhibit 4. In the course of this\njudgment, the court below per Muhammad, JCA\nafter referring to the above laws then said thus: -\n\"The respondent, therefore, in my view validly\nalienated and mortgaged the entire property held\nby it under the said Certificate of Occupancy to the\nappellant. Exhibit \"4\" (the first legal mortgage\nbetween the parties), in paragraph 2 thereof\nstates:\n'The mortgagor as BENEFICIAL OWNER and with\nthe consent required by and subject to the\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/53\nprovisions of the Land Tenure Law hereby demises\nunto the Bank ALL THAT the land and premises of\nwhich particulars are given in the schedule hereto\n18\nTO HOLD to the Bank for all the unexpired residue\n(except the last THREE (3) days thereof) of the\nterm of years granted therein by the Certificate of\nOccupancy of which particulars are given in the\nschedule hereto subject to the proviso for\nredemption following namely that if all moneys\nherein before covenanted to be paid shall be paid\naccordingly then the term hereby created shall\ncease.'\nThe schedule referred to in the above paragraph\nis Annexed to the exhibit. It reads in part as\nfollows:\nTHE SCHEDULE above referred to:- All that piece\nor parcel of landed property of OWONIBOYS\nTECHNICAL SERVICES LTD. with the improvements\nand buildings erected thereon situate and lying at\nOja Iya Oyo-Bye-Pass, Ilorin, Kwara State, more\nparticularly described in the title deed registered as\nfollows:-\nBoth Exhibits D1 and 5 which were respectively\nexecuted on the 8th day of December, 1976 and\n22nd day of June, 1978 were clearly related in\ntheir preambles to Exhibit 4. It is stated in Exhibit\nD1 as follows:\nWHEREAS the mortgagor had by a deed of legal\nmortgage described in the Second Schedule hereto\ncharged by way of legal mortgage the property\ndescribed in the First Schedule to secure an\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/53\noverdraft of N50,000.00 (Nigerian currency) from\nthe bank...\nAND WHEREAS the mortgagor and the bank\nhave agreed to increase the said overdraft of\n19\nN50,000 to the sum of One Hundred Thousand Naira\n(100,000.00, Nigerian Currency) on the same\nsecurity of landed property but with increased\nimprovements and on the same terms and\nconditions, mutatis mutandis, and in addition as\nhereby agreed.\nThis is what is exactly contained in Exhibit 5\nexcept for the increase in the overdraft sum which\nwas raised from N100,000.00 to N200,000.00. The\nlegal mortgage and property described in the\nvarious schedules thereto, in my understanding,\ncould refer to no others than the legal mortgage\ncontained in Exhibit 4 and that piece or parcel of\nland property of OWONIBOYS TECHNICAL\nSERVICES LTD. referred to in the schedule to that\nDeed of Legal Mortgage. It is also my\nunderstanding that Exhibits D1 and 5 were\nexecuted for the purposes of subsequent increase\nin the original amount of overdraft of N50,000.00\nsecured by appellant's Certificate of Occupancy No.\n540. This Certificate of Occupancy, as earlier on\nstated in respect of the said piece or parcel of land\nheld by the appellant OWONIBOYS TECHNICAL\nSERVICES LTD., ILORIN, with all the improvements\nand buildings erected thereon, situate and lying at\nOja-Iya, Oyo Bye Pass, Ilorin.\"\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/53\nAnd later in that judgment, his Lordship in holding\nthat it was the appellant who had the duty of\nseeking the consent of the Governor in the\nsubsequent transactions that led to Exhibits D 1\nand 5, said at p.311 of the judgment, thus: -\n20\n\"The transactions referred to in all the exhibits\nrelated to same property which is covered by\nCertificate of Occupancy No. 540. That Certificate\nof Occupancy was, with the consent of the\nGovernor, mortgaged to the appellant. I think it\nwas not the business of the Governor to insist to\nknow the value for which the respondent had\nwanted to mortgage the said property or that his\nconsent was made a pre-condition in the event of\nan increase in the value of the property. That\nwould have been too much of a demand and would\nhave engaged the Governor into making of\nagreements between parties which offends the\ndoctrine of freedom of contract. The Governor did\nall he was required to do by Section 27 of the Land\nTenure Law. The two later documents Exhibits D1\nand 5 were validly in my view, upstamped and\nregistered by the Lands Registry, Ilorin. They were\nan extension of the first Deed of Legal Mortgage. \"A\nmortgage\", in any event, has been defined by\nSection 51(1) of the Land Use Act, Cap. 202, LFN,\n1990 to include, \"a second and subsequent\nmortgage and equitable mortgage.\"\nThe view held by the Court below with regard to the\nquestion as to who has the duty of obtaining the\nconsent of the governor in transactions of the kinds\nthat occurred in the instant case was considered in\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n21/53\nthis Court in International Textile Industries (Nigeria)\nLtd. v. Dr. Ademola Oyekanmi Aderemi &\nOrs (1999) 8 NWLR (Pt.614) 268, where the\nholders of the right of a statutory right of\n21\noccupancy sought to avoid the consequences of the\ncontract to sell the piece of land which is the\nsubject-matter of the statutory right of occupancy.\nBefore I refer to the pertinent parts of the\njudgment, I need to quote S.22 of the Land Use\nAct. His Lordship Uwaifo, JSC who delivered the\nlead judgment then observed on the above\nprovisions of S.22 of the Act, thus:-\u00a0\n\"The position of S.22 of the Act is clearly this: A\nholder of a right of occupancy may enter into an\nagreement or contract, with a view to alienating his\nsaid right of occupancy. To enter into such an\nagreement or contract, he does not need the\nconsent of the Governor. He merely operates within\nthe first stage of a 'transfer on sale of an estate in\nland' which stage ends with the formation of a\nbinding contract for a sale constituting an estate\ncontract at best. But when he comes to embark on\nthe next stage of alienating or transferring his right\nof occupancy which is done by a conveyance or\ndeed, culminating in vesting the said right in the\n'purchaser', he must obtain the consent of the\nGovernor to make the transaction valid. If he fails\nto, then the transaction is null and void under\nS.26 of the Act\n. In my view, it is necessary to bear these\ntwo stages clearly in mind.\"\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/53\nAnd continued by quoting with approval what this\ncourt said in\nAwojugbagbe Light Industries Ltd. v. Chinukwe\n(supra) where Iguh, JSC, at pages\n435-436 said:-\n\"I think it ought to be stressed that the\u00a0holder\u00a0of\na\u00a0statutory\u00a0right\u00a0of\u00a0occupancy\u00a0is\u00a0certainly\u00a0not\n22\nprohibited\u00a0by Section\u00a022\u00a0(1)\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Act\u00a0from\nentering\u00a0into\u00a0some\u00a0form\u00a0of\u00a0negotiations\u00a0which\u00a0may\nend\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0written\u00a0agreement\u00a0for\u00a0presentation\u00a0to\nthe\u00a0Governor\u00a0for\u00a0his\u00a0necessary\u00a0consent\u00a0or\u00a0approval.\nThis\u00a0is\u00a0because\u00a0the\u00a0Land\u00a0Use\u00a0Act\u00a0does\u00a0not\u00a0prohibit\u00a0a\nwritten\u00a0agreement\u00a0to\u00a0transfer\u00a0or\u00a0alienate\u00a0land.\u00a0So\nlong\u00a0as\u00a0such\u00a0a\u00a0written\u00a0agreement\u00a0is\u00a0understood\u00a0and\nentered\u00a0\u00a0into\u00a0\u00a0subject\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0\u00a0consent\u00a0\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0the\nGovernor,\u00a0there\u00a0will\u00a0no\u00a0contravention\u00a0of\nSection\u00a022 (1)\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Land\u00a0Use\u00a0Act\n\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0mere\u00a0fact\u00a0that\u00a0such\na\u00a0written\u00a0agreement\u00a0is\u00a0executed\u00a0before\u00a0it\u00a0is\nforwarded\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0Governor\u00a0for\u00a0his\u00a0consent.

The appellant in the instant\nappeal sought and obtained the consent of the\nGovernor when it set out to obtain the first loan for\nthe sum N50,000.00 in 1973. By that transaction,\n23\nit effectively transferred its interest in the land to\nthe respondent as clearly spelt out in the mortgage\ndeed. True enough, he obtained further overdrafts\nand deeds of mortgages were executed to effect the\ntransaction upon the same property upon which the\nfirst loan of N50,000.00 was obtained. The first\nobservation that must be made is that it is the\nrespondent to whom the appellant had transferred\nits legal interest that had deliberately taken the\nrisk of granting more overdrafts in respect of the\nproperty in question. That will be the position even\nif no legal mortgages were executed as was done in\nthe instant case. The basis of this being that the\nrespondent would have taken its decision to lend\nmore money to the appellant as it was satisfied that\nthe value of the appellant's property would be\nsufficient, if sold, to recover the loans made to the\nappellant. I do not however, with the contention of\nthe appellant that a merger had occurred as a\nresult of these transactions. In the instant case,\nwhat is under consideration is a simple process of\nborrowing money on a property made available by\nthe appellant for that purpose. It is clear, as was\nfound by the court below that the only beneficiary\nof the loans was the appellant and no one else.\nEven if as argued by the appellant, it is not as\nautomatic as the appellant had submitted. For a\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/53\nmerger to be created in such transactions, such an\nintention must be evinced in the documents from\nthe documents executed by the parties, or such\nevidence as would indicate the intention of the\nparties that they envisaged a merger of the\n24\nmortgages with one another. See Halsbury's Laws\nof England , 4th Edition, Vol. 16, par. 882, where\nthe learned authors said:-\n\"Equity is not guided by rules of law as to\nmerger, and both as regards the merger of a lesser\nestate in a greater, and a merger of a charge in the\nland, the question depends upon the intention,\nactual or presumed, of the person in whom the\ninterests become united.\"\nHaving regard to the views expressed above in\nrespect of the questions raised in this issue, I am\nclearly of the opinion that the court below was right\nto have concluded that the appellant had the duty\nto obtain consents in respect of the mortgaged\ndeeds, and that in any event there was no question\nof merger as canvassed for the appellant by its\nlearned counsel. In my humble opinion, the\nargument concerning the merger of the mortgaged\ndeeds is a mere ruse to avoid the liability incurred\nby the appellant on the mortgaged property. There\nis nothing proved to lead to the conclusion that Ex\nA, D1 and 5 are void and unenforceable.\nAccordingly this issue is resolved against the\nappellant.\nI will now consider issues 4 & 5 together. In respect\nof issue 4, the appellant is contending that apart\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/53\nfrom the deeds of mortgage, Exhibits 4, D1 and 5,\nno further evidence was led by either party.\nParticularly, it is argued for the appellant that the\nrespondent ought to have called evidence in\n25\nrespect of the clauses in the mortgage agreements.\nIt is in my view difficult to understand the purport\nof the contention being made for the appellant by\nlearned counsel. In the first place, it is expected\nthat the onus is on the appellant who initiated this\nclaim to prove its case. That has always been the\nguiding principle in our law. See Okubule v.\nOyagbola (1990) 4 NWLR (Pt.147) 723; Ike v.\nUgboaja (1993) 6 NWLR (Pt.301) 539. I therefore\ndo not see what evidence is required of the\nrespondent when the respondent has not been\nshown to have led evidence of a kind which shifted\nthe onus of proof of a particular point to the\nrespondent. See Nigerian Maritime Services Ltd. v.\nAfolabi (1978) 2 SC 79 at 84; Highgrade Maritime\nServices Ltd. v. First Bank of Nigeria Ltd. (1991) 1\nNWLR (Pt.167) 290. It must be remembered that it\nwas the appellant who initiated this case when its\nproperty was about to be sold for its failure to pay\nthe debt owed to the respondent. The pleadings and\nevidence led at the trial were directed at showing\nthat the debt was not established. Though the trial\ncourt upheld that position of the appellant, the\ncourt below has quite rightly rejected that finding\nof the trial court. The argument of learned Counsel\nin this Court has not with due respect, persuaded\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/53\nme to hold a contrary view as I do not need to\ncomment any further on the validity of Exhibits 4,\nD1 and 5 in view of what I have already said about\ntheir validity and enforceability in resolving issue 3\nagainst the appellant.\n26\nThe next point that now falls to be considered is\nthat raised in issue 5. It is the submission of\nlearned Counsel for the appellant that the only\nuniversal custom of bankers is that a bank only has\nthe right to charge simple interest and that this can\nonly be varied by agreement of the parties. In\nsupport of that submission, he made reference to\nCorsskill V. Bower Bower Turner (1863) 32 L.J.Ch.\n540 at 544. And then went on to argue that the\nonus of proving that the respondent has the\nunqualified right to charge 'any prevailing' interest.\nAnd further submits that as the evidence led by the\nrespondent in this regard is unreliable and was\ndeservedly rejected by the trial Court, there exists\nno basis upon which the respondent could have\nresisted the appellant's claim. For the resolution of\nthe question raised by this issue, recourse must be\nhad to Exhibits 4, D1 and 5 the mortgage deeds\nwhich no doubt formed the basis of the loan and\noverdraft facilities entered into by the parties. Now\nif the parties have agreed between themselves\nupon the conditions for the formation of a contract,\nand as in this case those conditions were embodied\nin documents as in Exhibits 4, D1 and 5, then they\nare bound by the terms and conditions set down in\nthe documents, and which was duly executed as\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/53\nwas done in this case. Having so bound themselves,\nit is not the function of the court to make a\ncontract for the parties, see Oyenuga v. Provisional\nCouncil of the University of Ife (1965) NMLR 9. In\nthe instant case, each of the Exhibits 4, D1 and 5,\nthe mortgage deeds has as their terms and\n27\nconditions a clause 3 which reads thus:-\n\"All interest payable on the moneys hereby\nsecured shall accrue due from day to day at the\nrate from time to time stipulated by the bank and\nmay be capitalized at such intervals as the bank\nmay from time to time prescribed but not more\noften than monthly and added to the moneys\nhereby secured and shall thereupon bear interest\naccordingly at the rate aforesaid.\"\nIt is interesting that in the case of U.B.N. v. Ozigi\n(1994) 3 NWLR (Pt.333) 385, a clause similar in\nmaterial terms was inserted in the mortgage deed\nthat had to be considered in determining the merits\nof that appeal. In the course of the consideration of\nthe meaning and effect of that clause, it was\nobserved as I have done above that the court\ncannot make a contract for the parties or to rewrite\nthe one they have made for themselves. Adio, JSC\nin that case then went on to make the following\nobservation:-\n\"In other words, the\u00a0words\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0document\u00a0must\nfirst\u00a0be\u00a0given\u00a0their\u00a0simple\u00a0and\u00a0ordinary\u00a0meaning\nand\u00a0under\u00a0no\u00a0circumstances\u00a0may\u00a0new\u00a0or\u00a0additional\nwords\u00a0\u00a0be\u00a0\u00a0imported\u00a0\u00a0into\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0\u00a0text\u00a0\u00a0unless\u00a0\u00a0the\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/53\ndocument\u00a0would\u00a0be\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0absence\u00a0of\u00a0that\u00a0which\u00a0is\nimported impossible to understand.

See Solicitor General,\nWestern Nigeria v. Adebonjojo (1971) 1 All NLR\n178.\"\n28\nAnd further on at page 405, His Lordship said\nthus:-\n\"The provision of clause 3 of the mortgage\nagreements is clear and unambiguous. It is possible\nto understand and apply it as it stands. There was,\ntherefore, no necessity to import new or additional\nwords into it to require prior consultation with, or\nthe giving of prior notice of increase in rates of\ninterest on the loan in question to the respondent.\nTherefore, failure of the appellant to hold prior\nconsultation with or to give prior notice to the\nrespondent about increase in rates of interest on\nthe loan could not, as the Court of Appeal held,\nresult in the nullification of the interest rates\nstipulated under the provision of clause 3 of the\nmortgage agreements.\"\nIn the instant case the complaint of the appellant is\nthat the only interest payable by the respondent is\nthat which he claimed was established by custom. It\nis ascertained that loans granted to customers of\nthe bank should be at simple interest. That may\nwell be but that is not the case. That cannot be the\nposition in respect of this matter. This is because,\nas I have earlier stated, the parties entered into\nagreement as evidenced by Exhibits 4, D1 and 5. In\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n29/53\nthose documents, clause 3 featured prominently\nand as has been explained in the case of Union\nBank of Nigeria v. Ozigi (supra) , the wordings of\nthis clause 3 are clear and unambiguous. There is\nnothing, which makes it imperative for the\nrespondent to charge interest on the loan as simple\n29\ninterest as argued by the appellant. The respondent\nquite clearly from the wordings of the said clause 3\nare entirely free to charge interest is that deemed\nnecessary upon the loan granted to the appellant.\nIt is clear to me that the court below properly\ndismissed the contention of the appellant that the\nrespondent had no right to have charged interest\nas was done on the loan granted to the appellant.\nWith the greatest respect to the learned Counsel for\nthe appellant, he has not advanced any reason for\nme to depart from the judgment of the Court below.\nIt follows that this issue must be resolved against\nthe appellant.\nI think it is also necessary to add that the further\nargument with the respondent should not have\nbeen allowed to succeed in this appeal by reason of\nthe facts that the respondent has no right to\nsucceed as it has not made a counter-claim to be\ndeserving of a judgment in its favour. It is not a\nmatter of having not filed a counter-claim. As I\nhave said earlier in this judgment, the appellant\nhad to commence this action against the\nrespondent wanting to act pursuant to the\nmortgage deed with the failure of the appellant to\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n30/53\npay what was adjudged as debt to the respondent.\nHaving failed to establish that he was not indebted\nto the respondent as he claimed, the respondent is\nentitled to the judgment in its favor simply for the\nfact that the appellant was unable to establish what\nit set out to prove. I therefore see no merit in this\ncontention which is the subject of the appellant's\n30\nissue 6. From what I have said above in this\njudgment, I do not see any need to consider\nspecially issue 7.\nThis appeal from all I have said above lacks merit\nand it is hereby dismissed by me. The judgment of\nthe Court below is hereby affirmed and I award\ncosts in the sum of N10,000.00 in favour of the\nrespondent.\nUTHMAN MOHAMMED, J.S.C.:I have read the lead\njudgment of my learned brother, Ejiwunmi, JSC,\nand the concurring judgment of my learned\nbrother, Uwaifo, JSC, and I agree with both of them\nthat this appeal has failed and ought to be\ndismissed. The two main issues for the\ndetermination of this appeal, in my view, are as\nfollows:\n\"3. Whether the Court below was right to have held\nthat the principles of merger of mortgages was\ninapplicable to Exhibits 4, 5 and D1 and whether\nthe further holding that the said exhibits were\nvalidly upstamped was not perverse.\n5. Whether the Court below was right to have held\nthat the respondent was entitled to vary the rate of\ninterest chargeable and whether without evidence\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/53\nthe court could take judicial notice of the Central\nBank monetary policy on which the parties did not\njoin issues.\"\nThe issues are the core issues identified for the\ndetermination of this appeal. In the two judgments\n31\nof my learned brothers which I mentioned above,\nthe two issues have been adequately considered. I\ndo not find it necessary to add anything of my own\nto those decisions. For the reasons disclosed\ntherein, I dismiss this appeal. I award N10,000.00\ncosts in favour of the respondent.\nALOYSIUS IYORGYER KATSINA-ALU, J.S.C.:I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgments\nof my learned brothers, Ejiwunmi, JSC and Uwaifo, JSC.\nI agree with them and for the reasons which they give I\nwould dismiss the appeal.\nI shall however say a few words on issues 2 and 3.\nIssue 2 is whether the ruling by the trial court\nrefusing an amendment of the statement of defence\nshould have been appealed within 14 days as of\nright or appealed thereafter only with leave of this\ncourt along with an appeal against the final\njudgment. In this connection the Court of Appeal\nper Muhammad, JCA stated in the course of its\njudgment as follows:\n\"In the instant appeal, ground No. 13, to my\nunderstanding, questions the refusal by the trial\nJudge to grant the appellant further amendment to\nits statement of defence. The refusal, in my view,\npredetermined the appeal (the case) one way or\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/53\nthe other as it shut out completely the appellant\nfrom presenting its case properly. That certainly\naffects the whole case and I think the appellant had\nevery right to challenge that decision after the\nwhole case was over at the trial. That is exactly\n32\nwhat the appellant did.\"\nI think the Court of Appeal stated the position\ncorrectly. To raise the appeal on such a ruling as of\nright along with an appeal against the final\njudgment of the trial High Court would, in my view,\ndepend entirely on the overall effect of such a\nruling on the merit of the case: see International\nAgricultural Industries (Nig.) Ltd. v. Chika Brothers\nLtd. (1990) 1 NWLR (Pt. 124) 70. The amendment\nsought for was meant to put the pleading in line\nwith the evidence already led. It cannot be denied\nthat the amendment sought forms an intergral part\nof the structure of the case presented by the\nappellant. I think the Court of Appeal was right to\nhold that it was unnecessary to obtain leave to\nraise a ground of appeal on the facts of this case.\nIssue 3 raises the question of the principle of\nmerger in regard to the mortgage transaction\ncreated by Exhibits 4, D1 and 5. Exhibit 4 was the\ndeed of mortgage to secure the first loan of\nN50,000.00. The Governor's consent was obtained.\nThe amount of loan was later raised to\nN100,000.00. A new deed of mortgage was\nexecuted - this is Exhibit D1. Again the amount was\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n33/53\nraised to N200,000.00. Another deed of mortgage\nwas executed, Exhibit 5. It must be borne in mind\nthat Exhibits 4, D1 and 5 were concerned with one\nproperty which, by Exhibit 4 the Governor's consent\nwas obtained for the use of the property as a\ncollateral for the loan transaction. What this means\n33\nis that the Governor's consent is not required for\nthe additional deeds of mortgage executed in\nExhibits D1 and 5.\nFor the above reasons and for the fuller reasons\ngiven by my learned brothers, Ejiwunmi, JSC and\nUwaifo, JSC I too dismiss the appeal with\nN10,000.00 costs to the respondent.\nUMARU ATU KALGO, J.S.C.:I have had the opportunity\nof reading in draft the judgment of my learned\nbrother, Ejiwunmi, JSC just delivered in this\nappeal. I agree with him entirely that there is no\nmerit at all in this appeal and it ought to be\ndismissed. For the reasons which were given in the\nsaid judgment, which I adopt as mine, I also\ndismiss this appeal and affirm the decision of the\nCourt of Appeal. I award the costs of N10,000.00 in\nfavour of the respondent.\nSAMSON ODEMWINGIE UWAIFO, J.S.C.:I had the advantage of reading in advance the\njudgment of my learned brother, Ejiwunmi, JSC.\nI agree with him that this appeal be dismissed.\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n34/53\nThe short facts of the case are that the appellant\napplied for a secured loan of N50,000.00. It used\nits landed property at Oja Iya, Taiwo Road, Ilorin,\nas collateral. A deed of mortgage was executed for\nthis purpose with the Governor's consent. That is\nExhibit 4. Later the loan was increased to\nN100,000.00 and another deed of mortgage was\n34\nexecuted to reflect this amount, which deed was\naccordingly upstamped. It is Exhibit D1. Still later,\nthe loan was increased to N200,000.00. The same\nprocedure was followed. The deed is Exhibit 5. The\nGovernor's consent was not sought in respect of\nExhibits D1 and 5.\nThe respondent alleged that the appellant failed to\nrepay the loan together with the accrued interest in\naccordance with the terms of the agreement. It\ndecided to exercise its power of sale of the property\nas provided under the deed of mortgage. The\nappellant on the other hand disputed it was owing.\nIt alleged that it discovered several multiple debits\nof particular cheques which when sorted out would\nleave it with enormous credit balance. It also\ncontended that the Governor's consent was not\nobtained for Exhibits D1 and 5 and that they were\nnull and void as a result. It then argued that since\nExhibit 4 has ceased to exist on the principle of\nmerger, there was no valid mortgage upon which\nthe power to sell its property could be exercised by\nthe respondent. Finally, it contended that even if\nthere was a subsisting deed of mortgage, the\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n35/53\noriginally agreed interest rate could not be\nincreased by the respondent and used to calculate\nits liability without both parties agreeing upon such\nan increase.\nIt was on the basis of these contentions that the\nappellant brought action at the High Court, Ilorin,\nfor the following reliefs in para. 32 of the further\n35\namended statement of claim:\n\"(i) DECLARATION that the mortgages between the\nplaintiff and the defendant covering the plaintiff's\nproperty situate, lying and being at Taiwo Road,\nIlorin are illegal, unlawful, unenforceable and\nirregular.\n(ii) AN ORDER setting aside the mortgages.\n(iii) ALTERNATIVELY DECLARATION that the\ndefendant is not entitled to sell any property of the\nplaintiff without complying with the Land Use Act\nand the Auctioneers Law applicable to Kwara State.\n(iv) DECLARATION that the defendant is only\nentitled to charge on the plaintiff's account interest\nat the rate prevailing when facility was granted to\nthe plaintiff.\n(v) DECLARATION that the debit balance in the\naccount of the plaintiff is not a true and accurate\nreflection of the indebtedness of the plaintiff, if\nany, to the defendant.\n(vi) INJUNCTION restraining the defendant by\nthemselves, their agents, servants and or privies or\notherwise howsoever from selling the plaintiff's\nproperty pursuant to the said mortgages.\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n36/53\n(vii) DECLARATION that the deeds of mortgage\nregistered as No. 122/122/1 and 45/45/6\nrespectively have been discharged by their\nincorporation in the Deed registered as No.94/94/8.\n(viii) AN ORDER directing the defendant to pay to\nthe plaintiff the sum of N500,000.00 or any\namount the court may find the plaintiff entitled to\nrecover from the defendant.\"\n36\nOn 14 April, 1994 the trial court (per Gbadeyan, J.)\ngave judgment for the appellant in respect of all\nthe reliefs claimed in the said para.32 when the\njudgment was concluded thus:\n\"The bank has been shown by both P.W.1 and\nP.W.2 to have wrongfully debited N550,000.00\nagainst the plaintiff. There is no evidence to\ncontradict that the debit entry of N550,000.00 was\nwrongful. On the preponderance of evidence the\nplaintiff's case for its award is established.\nConsequently, the plaintiff's case which is in the\nalternative, succeeds in its entirety and the defence\nfails. All the reliefs claimed in paragraph 32 of the\nfurther amended statement of claim are hereby\ngranted.\"\nThe Court of Appeal, Kaduna Division on 25\nNovember, 1996 set aside the judgment and\ndismissed the claim. The appellant in his appeal to\nthis court has raised a number of issues. Further\ndetails of the facts of the case and the entire issues\nfor determination have been stated in the judgment\nof my learned brother, Ejiwunmi, JSC. I need not\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n37/53\nreproduce those issues nor delve into those further\nfacts.\nI shall briefly touch on and discuss some of the\nissues raised in this appeal as set out in the leading\njudgment. Issue 1 is about the competence of some\ngrounds of appeal permitted to be argued by the\ncourt below. They were couched as a misdirection\nof law (or error in law) and error of facts at the\n37\nsame time. This issue was abandoned by the\nlearned Senior Advocate for the appellant in view\nof the fact that it had been settled in some recent\ncases that such framing of grounds of appeal does\nnot necessarily make them incompetent: see\nAderounmu v. Olowu (2000) 4 NWLR (Pt.652) 253,\na decision of this court. See also Thor Ltd. v. First\nCity Merchant Bank Ltd. (1997) 1 NWLR (Pt.479)\n35. Incidentally, it was the\nobiter dictum of Nnaemeka-Agu, JSC in Nwadike\nv. Ibekwe (1987) 4 NWLR (Pt.67) 718 at 744 which\nwas applied in many decisions of the Court below\nupholding this kind of objection to such ground of\nappeal that appellant had relied on.\nIssue 2 is whether the ruling by the trial court\nrefusing an amendment of the statement of defence\nshould have been appealed within 14 days as of\nright or appealed thereafter only with leave along\nwith an appeal against the final judgment. I think\nwhether it is permissible to raise the appeal on\nsuch a ruling as of right along with an appeal\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n38/53\nagainst the final judgment of a High Court sitting at\nfirst instance depends entirely on the overall effect\nof such a ruling on the merit of the case. The Court\nbelow per Muhammad, JCA stated the position\ncorrectly, in my view, when the following\nobservation was made:\n\"In the instant appeal, ground No.13, to my\nunderstanding, questions the refusal by the trial\nJudge to grant the appellant further amendment to\nits statement of defence. The refusal, in my view,\n38\npredetermined the appeal (sic: the case) one way\nor the other as it shut out completely the appellant\nfrom presenting its case properly. That certainly\naffects the whole case and I think the appellant had\nevery right to challenge that decision after the\nwhole case was over at the trial. That is exactly\nwhat the appellant did.\"\nIt seems to me that there could be several rulings\nin the course of a trial which, in effect, would be\nseen as forming an incident of the proceedings as\nwhole. Some of such rulings, for example on\nadmissibility of a document, may not need to be\npursued on appeal as and when they are given but\nwhere necessary may become matters to be\nincluded in the appeal against the final judgment:\nsee International Agricultural Industries (Nig.) Ltd.\nv. Chika Brothers Ltd. (1990) 1 NWLR (Pt. 124) 70\nat 81 per Obaseki, JSC. Whether this is a proper\ncourse depends entirely on the matters ruled upon\nas to whether they form an integral part of the\nstructure of the case presented by the party in the\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n39/53\nsense that any complaint about any particular\nruling is likely to reflect on the result of the case.\nFor instance, a refusal to allow an amendment to a\npleading may tend to affect the outcome of the case\nand present itself in consequence as an issue of a\ndenial of a fair opportunity to present a proper\ncase. In my opinion, the court below was right to\nhold that it was unnecessary to obtain leave to\nraise a ground of appeal on a ruling complaining of\nsuch denial since the amendment was meant to put\n39\nthe pleading in line with the evidence already led. I\nbelieve this could be seen as an appeal as of right\nagainst the final decision under Section 241 (1)(a)\nof the 1999 Constitution.\nIssue 3 raises the question of the principle of\nmerger in regard to the mortgage transaction\ncreated by Exhibits 4, D1 and 5. Exhibit 4 was the\ndeed of mortgage to secure the first loan of\nN50,000.00. When the amount of loan or credit\nfacilities was raised to N100,000.00 a,new deed of\nmortgage was executed. This is Exhibit D1. Again,\nwhen the amount was raised to N200,000.00,\nanother deed of mortgage was executed, Exhibit 5.\nBut it must be recognized that all three were in\nrespect of the same and only property used as\ncollateral.\nLearned Senior Advocate for the appellant has\nargued that once an earlier deed of legal mortgage\nis incorporated into a later one, the former ceases\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n40/53\nto exist on its own and is in fact extinguished. The\nwhole purpose of this argument is further carried\nforward that because it was in respect of Exhibit 4\nthat the Governor's consent was obtained, Exhibits\nD1 and 5 which, as argued extinguished Exhibit 4\nare themselves not enforceable (or are indeed null\nand void) since the Governor's consent was not\ngiven in respect of them. The authority cited for the\nproposition is contained in para. 884 of Halsbury's\nLaws of England 4th Edn., Vol. 32 (Reissue) though\nCounsel referred to para. 979 of the original issue\n40\nwhich is verbatim, but which he quoted partially. I\nshall reproduce the entire para. thus:\n\"884. General rule. As a general rule, by taking or\nacquiring, a security of a higher nature in legal\nvaluation than one he already possesses, a person\nmerges and extinguishes his legal remedies upon\nthe inferior security or cause of action; thus the\ntaking of a bond or covenant, or the obtaining of a\njudgment for a simple contract debt, merges and\nextinguishes the simple contract debt. For this\npurpose, however, the superior security must be\nco-extensive with the inferior security and between\nthe same parties. A security given by one of two\nco-debtors to secure a simple contract debt does\nnot merge the simple contract debt.\"\nThe learned Senior Advocate for the respondent\nhas on the other hand submitted that it was\nunnecessary to have a fresh consent of the\nGovernor for Exhibits D1 and 5 otherwise they\nwould not have been registered, citing Odubeko v.\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n41/53\nFowler (1993) 7 NWLR (Pt.308) 637, (1993) 9\nSCNJ (Pt.2) 185 at 195. The further submission is\nthat, in any case, it was the duty of the appellant\n(the mortgagor) to obtain the necessary consent,\nciting Awojugbagbe Light Ind. Ltd. v. Chinukwe\n(1995) 4 NWLR (Pt.390) 379 and International\nTextile Ltd. v. Aderemi (1999) 8 NWLR (Pt.614)\n268, (1999) 6 SC (Pt. 1) 1.\nA proper understanding of the passage from\nHalsbury's Laws of England (supra) is important.\n41\nWhat is considered there is a security of a higher\nnature in legal valuation subsuming an inferior\nsecurity. This has nothing to do with a security for\na higher amount of money or loan. It is concerned\nonly with the strength of one security over another\nin terms of legal superiority. The passage gives a\nsimple and clear example. If there is a debt which\nis supported by a mere simple contract, when this\nis replaced by a bond or covenant, or a judgment in\nrespect of the simple contract debt, there is no\nneed to rely on the simple contract. It would have\nbeen replaced by either the judgment or by a bond\nor covenant which is obviously a higher security of\nbetter dependability. Neither of them extinguishes\nthe debt (it indeed protects the debt) but the\nsimple contract which it replaces. In Twopenny v.\nYoung (1824) 107 ER 711 at 712 it was laid down\nby Bayley, J., that \"where a simple contract\nsecurity for a debt is given, it is extinguished by a\nspecialty, if the remedy given by the latter is\nco-extensive with that which the creditor had upon\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n42/53\nthe former.\" This was followed by Byles, J., in\nBoaler v. Mayor (1865) 19 C.B. (N.S.) 76 at 83;\n(1865) 144 ER 714 at 717.\nIn my view, it was a misconception, with due\nrespect, to rely on the passage in question from\nHalsbury's as authority for saying that Exhibits D1\nand 5 extinguished Exhibit 4 and with it the\nGovernor's consent. The said Exhibit 4 represents\nthe actual mortgage of the property concerned for\nwhich the Governor's consent was obtained. That\n42\nexhibit, as rightly argued by Mr. Alli, SAN, might\nhave sufficed by upstamping it to reflect the\nincrease in loan. Mr. Alli's contention of upstamping\nan original mortgage deed in case of increase in the\nloan first agreed, is right as I said, but purely on\nprinciple. To make it practical, the conveyancing\nprocedure of drawing up such a deed must make\nprovision for that contingency, so that by the mere\nendorsement of the deed with the amount of\nincrease in the loan, it can be upstamped for the\nincrease. This can be done as often as occasion\ndemands without having to execute a new deed.\nBut there is nothing wrong with the way Exhibits\nD1 and 5 came to be executed in the circumstances\nof Exhibit 4. Actually, with the draftsmanship of\nExhibit 4, I do not see how it could have been\nupstamped for the increased loans. That made\nExhibits D1 and 5 inevitable; but they certainly did\nnot call for the Governor's consent to be able to\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n43/53\nincrease the loan which both parties agreed on. The\nGovernor's consent as indicated in Exhibit 4 has\nnothing to do with the amount of loan; the consent\nis for the alienation of the legal title in the property\nto the respondent ( the mortgagee) in compliance\nwith Ss.22 and 26 of the Land Use Act, 1978, for\nthe period of the\u00a0 mortgage transaction.\nSo, no\u00a0further\u00a0consent\u00a0was necessary\n\u00a0just\u00a0because\u00a0further\u00a0loans\u00a0had\u00a0been\nobtained\u00a0upon\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0collateral. If Exhibit 4 had\nbeen an equitable mortgage and Exhibits D1 and 5\nbeing deeds of mortgage, it would be in accordance\n43\nwith principle for the latter to extinguish the former\nbecause they are both securities of a higher nature\nin legal valuation than an equitable mortgage.\nPara. 886 of Halsbury's Laws of England (supra)\nsupports this analysis. It reads:\n\"A mere charge or equitable mortgage is\nextinguished by the taking of a formal mortgage,\neven though the mortgage does not confer a legal\nestate, and the sum from then on secured is the\nsum mentioned in the mortgage notwithstanding\nthat other sums were covered by the deposit.\"\nThe authority in support is Vaughan v.\nVanderstegen (1854) 61 ER 730 where, at page\n732, Sir R.T. Kindersley V-C. in discussing the\nprinciple of merger, said inter alia:\n\"In November 1844 Mr. Annesley, finding that\nLady Dunboyne owed him considerable costs,\nbecame desirous of having a security for them. At\nthe same time Lady Dunboyne applied to him to\nadvance her 30, and the policy was then deposited\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n44/53\nby Lady Dunboyne with Annesley, by way of\nsecuring the costs and the 30.\nA few weeks after, another occasion arose for an\nadvance of money by Annesley, viz ., for paying a\npremium on the policy, and then he required some\nbetter security than a mere deposit, and the\nmortgage was agreed upon.... When a mortgage is\ngiven to go as near as possible to the conveyance\nof a legal estate, you must look to that deed alone\nto see what security was intended, that is, to what\ncontract the property was intended to be subject...\n44\nThe policy is, I think, in the hands of Mr. Annesley,\nnot by virtue of the deposit, but of the mortgage,\nand when that is satisfied he has no further right to\nhold it (the deposit). The possession by the deposit\nis merged in the possession under the\nmortgage.\"\nWhat is referred to here as \"the deposit\" is the\nequitable mortgage by way of deposit of the deed of\nconveyance to secure a loan. It should be\nunderstood that merger may take the form of a\nmerger of estates or of a merger of a charge in the\nland. It is the merger of an equitable mortgage with\nthe legal mortgage in land that para.886 quoted\nabove and Vaughan's case (supra) reflect.\nIn the present case, there was no question of the\nprinciple of merger operating because all the said\nExhibits 4, D1 and 5 are deeds of mortgage which\nare securities of the same nature in legal valuation.\nThey were not intended to merge in the sense that\ntakes place between a lower and higher legal\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n45/53\nsecurities except that it is necessary to say that\nExhibits D1 and 5 complement Exhibit 4 in regard\nto the amount of money secured. Other than that,\nit must be recognised that they are concerned with\none property which, by Exhibit 4, the Governor's\nconsent has permitted the said property to be used\nas a collateral for the loan transaction. It is said\nthat a mortgage is not merged by the taking of a\nnew mortgage on the same property to cover the\noriginal debt and further advances: see para. 887\nof Halsbury's Laws of England (supra). In the\n45\ncircumstances it was, in my view, proper to\nupstamp the relevant exhibits to reflect the further\nadvances or loans made to the appellant in\nconsequence of the authorised mortgage\ntransaction. The court below took the correct view\nin this regard.\nAs regards issues 4, 5 and 6, the appellant has\nconceded, quite rightly, in its brief of argument that\nif Exhibits 4, D1 and 5 are valid, the respondent\ncan exercise the power of sale conferred on it by\nthose exhibits. I have reached the conclusion that\nthe exhibits are valid. The consent of the Governor\nfor the mortgage transaction covers all the deeds of\nmortgage. Those deeds are in respect of one\ntransaction, namely mortgage to secure money\nlending although the lending came to involve first\nadvance and further advances. It does not matter\nwhether the Governor's consent came before or\nafter negotiation for the lending was concluded: see\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n46/53\nAwojugbagbe Light Ind. Ltd. v. Chinukwe (supra);\nInternational Textile Ltd. v. Aderemi (supra ).\nAn aspect of the argument of the appellant is that\nsince the respondent did not counterclaim, \"it is a\nmoot point whether it can exercise a right of sale or\nnot as an unpaid mortgagee\". The argument then\nwent further as to the conditions to be fulfilled\nbefore power of sale can be exercised as contained\nin clause 6 of Exhibit 4 which conditions include\nproof of the indebtedness of the mortgagor, notice\ngiven by the mortgagee for payment and failure of\n46\nthe mortgagor to pay within one month of the\nletter of demand. I think the argument has to be\nconsidered on the basis of what was placed before\nthe two courts below for a decision and what they\nactually decided. The claim on this point by the\nappellant was for a declaration that the respondent\nis not entitled to sell any property of the appellant\nwithout complying with the Land Use Act and the\nAuctioneers Law applicable in Kwara State. The\ntrial court made the declaration sought for on the\nground that it was not proved that the appellant\nwas owing the respondent. The Court of Appeal\nfound that conclusion to be wrong. Consequently, it\nexpressed the view that the respondent is entitled\nto exercise its power of sale. That of course implies\nthat this may be done upon compliance with all\nnecessary conditions. I do not think the said view\ncan only be expressed upon a counter-claim by the\nrespondent. It follows from the consequences of the\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n47/53\ndismissal of the said claim of the appellant. It was\nnot an order made which was intended to be\ncarried out by virtue of these proceedings.\nThere is the issue of the amount and nature of\ninterest the respondent was entitled to having\nregard to clause 3 of the deed of mortgage (per\nExhibits 4, D1 and 5) which reads:\n\"All interest payable on the moneys hereby\nsecured shall accrue due from day to day at the\nrate from time to time stipulated by the Bank and\nmay be capitalized at such intervals as the Bank\nmay from time to time prescribe but not more often\n47\nthan monthly and added to the moneys hereby\nsecured and shall thereupon bear interest\naccordingly at the rate aforesaid.\"\nThis implies compound interest made to operate\nupon monthly or not more often than monthly rest.\nThe appellant's argument is that 10% interest per\nannum was stated or agreed as per Exhibit 4 and\nthat the Central Bank of Nigeria's directive pleaded\nby the respondent was not tendered by the\nrespondent. The said clause 3 was interpreted by\nthis court in Union Bank of Nigeria Ltd. v. Ozigi\n(1994) 3 NWLR (Pt.333) 385. This Court considered\nthe terms thereof unambiguous as then observed\nthus inter alia per Adio, JSC at pp. 403-404:\n\"If the prevailing interest rates (prime rates)\nfixed by the Central Bank vary from time to time,\nthen the interest rates stipulated by the appellant,\nthat was under obligation as a bank to comply with\nthe Central Bank guidelines in the matter, could\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n48/53\nnot be fixed: it had to vary from time to time in\nresponse to the Central Bank guidelines ... The\nprovision of clause 3 of the mortgage agreements\ncan be relied upon to stipulate rates of interest in\nresponse to the C.B.N.'s guidelines on the matter.\"\nThe argument of the appellant that the interest\nrate of 10% stipulated in the mortgage deed cannot\nbe varied in line with clause 3 has failed to take\naccount of the wording of the clause and the\nstatement of principle in this regard in Union Bank\nof Nigeria Ltd. v. Ozigi (supra).\nThe appellant's Counsel argued further that the\n48\nCentral Bank's directive pleaded by the respondent\nwas not tendered to support its entitlement to a\nhigher rate of interest. I think, with due respect,\nthe argument does not arise having regard to the\nnature of the claim before the court in this suit.\nThe appellant's claim is that the 10% interest is\nfixed and cannot be varied. That is what the court\nwas called upon to decide. The Central Bank's\ndirective is not needed to interpret clause 3 of the\nmortgage deed. It will only be needed to ascertain\nwhat the variation is from time to time when there\nis a claim to a particular quantum of interest based\non an alleged higher interest rate as directed by\nthe Central Bank. Such a claim was not an issue in\nthis action.\nThe contention of the appellant about multiple\ndebits of some of its cheques is not convincing. The\nevidence it relied on is that the respondent\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n49/53\nfraudulently debited the appellant with cheques\nissued by it in several ledgers rather than just once\na paid cheque should be reflected in the ledger. The\nchartered accountants commissioned by the\nappellant to check the bank statement carried out\ntwo specific assignments, namely (a) the\ndifferential in interest charged by the respondent\nabout the 10% stated in the mortgage deed and (b)\nthe debiting of the account more than once in\nrespect of some cheques. One of the chartered\naccountants who testified as P.W.1, Isaiah Adeoti\nAdeniran, worked the interest due on 10%\nthroughout. He said that he relied on the figure of\n49\nthe 10% given to him by the appellant and\nadmitted thus: \"If there is another agreed interest\nrate between the parties not supplied to me my\nfinding will then be wrong.\" This shows that the\nwitness was not given the increased interest rate to\nwork on.\nIn respect of the alleged double debiting of\ncheques, the witness was not helpful to the\nappellant. He referred to different entries from the\ncompilation made by him in which he quoted\nshortened cheque numbers, usually the three last\nfigures on a cheque leaf. Those cheques appeared\nin more than one entry. But the witness himself\nsaid that the real figure in a cheque leaf is more\nthan three digits and that what he stated in his\ncompilation was the shortened form not the digits\nquoted in full. He then admitted thus: \"It is not\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n50/53\npossible to have more than one entry in respect of\none cheque.\" The sole witness for the defence,\nDW1, Remi Okulaja who works for the respondent\nbank, explained in detail the entries in the\nstatement of account. The Court below gave\nadequate consideration to the evidence led and\ncame, in my view, to the correct decision that the\nstatement of account reflected genuine entries and\nthe indebtedness of the appellant to the\nrespondent. It is very strange that the trial Court\nawarded the sum of N550,000.00 to the appellant\nas the total amount arising from multiple debiting\nwhen even P.W.1 admitted that if his calculation\nhad been correct the appellant would be owing\n50\nN34,389.44 as overdraft. On the whole, the\nevidence as to alleged multiple wrong entries or\nwithdrawals does not at all prove the allegation.\nIn all the circumstances, I too find no merit in this\nappeal and accordingly dismiss it with N10,000.00\ncosts.\nAppeal dismissed.\n51\n5/8/25, 11:19 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n51/53\nYusuf Ali, SAN (with him, S.

In my view if it becomes apparent on the record that a judgment which is relied on as res judicata is in fact a nullity through excess or lack of\nJurisdiction, it is the duty of Trial and an Appeal Court of its own motion to take up the point provided opportunity is given to both sides to adduce\narguments on the issue. In the case of Westminister Bank Ltd. v. Edwards, (1942) A.C. 529, Viscount Simon, L.C., says this at page 533:- Moreover, the\nquestion was not in issue. There are of course, cases in which a Court should itself take an objection of its own, even though the point is not raised by any\nparties to it. After giving certain instances of when this may be done, the judgment continues thus:- Again, a Court not only may, but should, take objection\nwhere the absence of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the proceedings. Thus an appellate Court not only may, but must, take objection that it has no\njurisdiction to hear an appeal if it is apparent that no right of appeal exists. Lord Wright, at page 536 of the same report, says this:- Now it is clear that a\nCourt is not entitled but bound to put an end to proceedings if at any stage and by any means it becomes manifest that they are incompetent. It can do so\nof its own initiative, even though the parties have consented to the irregularity, because as Willes, J., said in City of London Corporation v. Cox (3) in the\ncourse of giving the answers of the Judges to this House, \"mere acquiescence does not give jurisdiction.\" In Farquharson v. Morgan (4) Lord Halsbury states\nthe principle thus:- It has been long settled that, where an objection to the jurisdiction of an inferior Court appears on the face of the proceedings, it is\nimmaterial by what means and by whom the Court is informed of such objection. The Court must protect the prerogative of the Crown and the due course\nof the administration of Justice by prohibiting the inferior Court from proceeding in matters as to which it is apparent that it has no jurisdiction. That was a\ncase of prohibition, but I think the general principle applies equally to the duty of the Court to take the objection when it becomes apparent in the course\nof proceedings before it in an appeal. The words of Lord Wright in the passage to which I have referred are very strong indeed- \"at any stage and by any\nmeans\". (DISSENTING)\nJUDGMENT AND ORDER - ORDER OF COURT - Whether a court is competent to make an order which even if erroneous in law or in fact is within\nits competence\n\"I now turn to the order of the District Officer, for if he acted in excess of the jurisdiction given him by the Native Courts Ordinance, if he had no power to\nmake the order which he in fact made, then that order is a nullity, and no matter what happened subsequently in the Native Court, no matter what the\nparties may have agreed upon, the proceedings subsequent to the order are a nullity. Now the power of the District Officer on hearing an appeal are\ncontained in S.40 of the aforesaid Ordinance, which reads thus:- A Native Court of Appeal, a Magistrate's Court, the High Court, a District Officer, a Resident\nor the Governor in the exercise of his appellate jurisdiction under this Ordinance may- (a) after rehearing the whole case or not, make any such Order or\npass any such Sentence as the Court of first instance could have made or passed in such cause or matter ;(b) order any such cause or matter to be\nreheard before the Court of first instance or before any other native Court or before any Magistrate's Court. It is with S. 40 (b) that we are here concerned,\nfor the District Officer never reheard the case. Was the order of the District Officer an order that the case should be reheard or was it an order sending the\ncase back for certain witnesses to be heard? If it was the former, the order was perfectly valid; if the latter, it was invalid. In the case of Timitimi v. Amabebe\n14 WACA 374 at 377, Coussey JA. said that: There is a distinction between an order or judgment which a Court is not competent to make and an order\nwhich, even if erroneous in law or in fact, is within the Court's competency.\" (DISSENTING)\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - COURT PROCEEDINGS - Whether the proceedings of a competent court may be attacked on the ground of\nirregularity in the conduct of the trial\n\"If the Court is competent, the proceedings are not a nullity; but they may be attacked on the ground of irregularity in the conduct of the trial; the argument\nwill be that the irregularity was so grave as to affect the fairness of the trial and the soundness of the adjudication. It may turn out that the party\ncomplaining was to blame, or had acquiesced in the irregularity; or that it was trivial; in which case the appeal court may not think fit to set aside the\njudgment. A defect in procedure is not always fatal.\"\nCOURT - JURISDICTION - Conditions that must be satisfied before a Court is competent to exercise its jurisdiction in respect of any matter\n\"Before discussing those portions of the record, I shall make some observations on jurisdiction and the competence of a court. Put briefly, a Court is\ncompetent when (1) it is properly constituted as regards numbers and qualifications of the members of the bench, and no member is disqualified for one\nreason or another; and (2) the subject matter of the case is within its jurisdiction, and there is no feature in the case which prevents the court from\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/32\nexercising its jurisdiction: and (3) the case comes before the court initiated by due process of law, and upon fulfillment of any condition precedent to the\nexercise of jurisdiction. Any defect in competence is fatal, for the proceedings are a nullity however well conducted and decided: the defect is extrinsic to\nthe adjudication.\"\nEVIDENCE - ESTOPPEL PER REM JUDICATAM/RES JUDICATA - Doctrine of res judicata\n\"The rule of res judicata is derived from the maxim of nemo debet bis vexaripro eadem causa. It is the causa that matters; and a plaintiff cannot, by\nformulating a fresh claim, re-litigate the same causa. That is why Section 53 of the Evidence Act does not speak of the claim, but of the facts directly in\nissue in the previous case.\"\nEVIDENCE - ESTOPPEL PER REM JUDICATAM/RES JUDICATA - Criteria for identification of the two actions in considering a plea of res judicata\n\"The following sentence, quoted at page 455 from Hunter v. Stewart, (1861), 45 De G.F. &amp; J. 168, at p. 178; 45 E.R. 1148 at p.1152, is also especially worth\nrepeating- One of the criteria of the identity of two suits, in considering a plea of res judicata, is the inquiry whether the same evidence would support\nboth.\"\nJUDGEMENT SUMMARY\nINTRODUCTION:\nThis appeal centers on the Issue of Jurisdiction.\nFACTS:\nIn the previous case (No. 33/56) before the Native Court of Mbatechete, the plaintiff claimed for his family yams etc., as customary rent for thirteen years under a lease\ngiven to the defendant in 1941 for building purposes, alleging that the defendant paid for two years and stopped. The defendant did not admit the claim. The plaintiff\ngave evidence that his family granted the defendant a piece of land to build on; that he brought them palm wine, and that they agreed on the rent, which he stopped\npaying after the ensuing year. The Court eventually gave judgment for the plaintiff.\nThere were proceedings on appeal which ended in a finding by the Senior Administrative officer, that the plaintiff had failed to prove title to the land on which the\ndefendant had his house and that there was inadequate evidence to support his claim that the defendant had leased the land in dispute from him; the judgment of the\nNative Court was set aside and the claim dismissed; and that decision was confirmed by the Deputy Governor on 23rd January, 1957.\u00a0 A year or so later, Gabriel\nMadukolu, who had brought the 1956 suit on his family's behalf, together with others sued the defendant anew in the Native Court claiming declaration of title to a\nparcel of land known and called 'Aniuno-Isigwu' where the defendant put up his compound.\u00a0The Native Court however delivered its judgment in favour of the plaintiff. \u00a0\nAgainst this Judgment the defendant appealed to the County Court Grade \"A\", which held as follows:-\nThe Plaintiffs/Respondents have made out their title case against the defendant-appellant but so far the defendant is occupying the compound land, we are awarding\nthe Plaintiffs/Respondents a Reversionary Title.\u00a0A further appeal was lodged by the defendant to the Magistrate's Court holden at Awka, and on the 23rd day of May,\n1959, the Learned Magistrate confirmed the decision of the County Court and dismissed the appeal.\nThe defendant appealed further to the High Court, which on the 23rd November, 1959, allowed the appeal and set aside the decisions of the Courts below. \u00a0Aggrieved\nby the decision of the High Court, the plaintiff appealed to the Federal Supreme Court.\nISSUES:\nThe questions raised in the appeal are:-\n(1) whether title to land was a fact directly in issue in the previous case between the parties;\n(2) whether the title was actually decided by the Court;\n(3) whether the title appears from the judgment itself to be the ground on which it was based.\nDECISION/HELD:\nOn the whole, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, however, John Idowu Conrad Taylor F.J dissented.\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n4/32\nVAHE ROBERT BAIRAMIAN, F.J. (Delivering the Leading\u00a0Judgment ): This appeal from the High Court of the Eastern Region (Betuel, J., at Onitsha on 23 November,\n1959) raises questions of res judicata and turns on the application of Section 53 of the Evidence Act, which provides that-Every judgment is conclusive proof, as\nagainst parties and privies, of facts directly in issue in the case, actually decided by the Court, and appearing from the judgment itself to be the ground on which it was\nbased; unless evidence was admitted in the action in which the judgment was delivered which is excluded in the action in which that judgment is intended to be\nproved.\nThe questions raised in this appeal are:-\n(1) whether title to land was a fact directly in issue in the previous case between the parties ;\n(2) whether the title was actually decided by the Court;\n(3) whether the title appears from the judgment itself to be the ground on which it was based.\nIn the previous case (No. 33/56) before the Native Court of Mbatechete, the plaintiff claimed for his family yams etc., as customary rent for thirteen years under a lease\ngiven to the defendant in 1941 for building purposes, alleging that\n1\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n5/32\nthe defendant paid for two years and stopped. The defendant did not admit the claim. The plaintiff gave evidence that his family granted the defendant a piece of land\nto build on; that he brought them palm wine, and that they agreed on the rent, which he stopped paying after the ensuing year. The very first question put by the\ndefendant was-\n\"In whose lifetime did I come to you with palm wine?\" Thus the plaintiff was alleging a grant of land, which the defendant was denying. At the outset of his evidence the\ndefendant said-\n\"The land on which I live is ours.\"\nThe plaintiff asked him-\n\"Can you swear with your brothers that this land in question belongs to you?\"\nThe defendant answered, \"yes\".\nAfter the defendant's case was concluded, the Court re-opened the hearing, and received from the plaintiff a copy of the proceedings in case No. 24/1937 as showing\nthat his family had obtained title against the defendant's late father. The Court eventually gave judgment for the plaintiff relying on that case as proving that \"where the\ndefendant put up his building belongs to the plaintiff\"; and the Court gave judgment for payment of rent.\u00a0\n2\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n6/32\nPlainly enough the dispute was on\u00a0whether the plaintiff's family were the owners of the land on which the defendant had his house; the title was actually decided by the\nCourt; and that appeared from the judgment itself to be the ground on which the judgment for payment of rent was based.\nThere were proceedings on appeal which ended in a finding by the Senior Administrative officer, that the plaintiff had failed to prove title to the land on which the\ndefendant had his house and that there was inadequate evidence to support his claim that the defendant had leased the land in dispute from him; the judgment of the\nNative Court was set aside and the claim dismissed; and that decision was confirmed by the Deputy Governor on 23rd January, 1957.\nA year or so later, Gabriel Madukolu, who had brought the 1956 suit on his family's behalf, together with others sued the defendant anew in the Native Court claiming\ndeclaration of title to a parcel of land known and called 'Aniuno-Isigwu' where the defendant put up his compound.\nThe defendant denied the claim. In questioning Madukolu the defendant reminded him of the former case. When the defendant gave evidence, he began by saying that\nthe case was\u00a0\n3\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n7/32\nres\u00a0judicata in the former case No. 33/56, which he had won. The plaintiff asked him-\n\"Do you know whether it was title to land or rent was claimed in civil suit No. 33/56 which you said you won\"\nAnd the defendant answered, \"It was case for rent\".\nThe judgment of the Native Court was for the plaintiffs; it did not deal with the plea of res judicata.\nRes judicata was included as a ground of complaint in the appeal to the County Court. The County Court observed that the former case was for payment of rent and\nnot for declaration of title; that the appellate judgment in that case was good so far as rent was concerned, but ultra vires in regard to title. The County Court awarded\nthe plaintiffs a reversionary title, which was upheld by the Magistrate, but reversed by the High Court; hence this appeal by the plaintiffs.\nThe ground of appeal argued is that-\nThe learned Judge in the Court below is wrong in law when he held that the issue of tenancy in Mbatechete Native Court suit 33/1956 was res judicata.\nIt must be admitted that the judgement is not consistent. At one point it states that-\nThe County Court did consider it (viz. the judgement of the Senior Administrative\n4\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/32\nOfficer in the former suit) and rightly disregarded the remark that the respondents had failed to prove title, which was not directly in issue, but the second arm, that no\ntenancy was proved and the dismissal of the claim for rent was not given its due weight. \u00a0\nIf title was not directly in issue, then one of the elements of res judicata was absent.\nThe learned Judge gives it as his view that-\nThe judgement is not only conclusive with reference to the actual matter decided but to the grounds for the decision.\nThat is true provided that the ground for the decision relates to a fact directly in issue.\nUltimately the judgement states that-\nIn the circumstances of this case, if the issue of tenancy is res judicata, so is the issue of title since one is based upon the other.\nThat seems to say this: the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant was their tenant as a person to whom they had granted land of their own to build on and pay rent for;\nso the claim of tenancy was based on a claim of ownership; so the former judgment was conclusive on title as well as on tenancy by lease. In effect the learned Judge\nregarded title as being a fact directly in issue in the former\n5\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/32\ncase by necessary implication.\nThe argument for the plaintiffs in their appeal before us was that the claim in the former suit was for rent; that the issue there was whether the defendant owed rent;\nand that was what the Native Court adjudicated upon: there was no issue on title, according to the argument, and the case was not fought on that issue; the dismissal\nof the suit by the Senior Administrative officer decided nothing, as the suit was not for a declaration of title: further, according to the argument, if the defendant tried\nto raise the issue of title, he did so too late.\nThe rule of res judicata is derived from the maxim of nemo debet bis vexari pro eadem causa. It is the causa that matters; and a plaintiff cannot, by formulating a fresh\nclaim, re-litigate the same causa. That is why Section 53 of the Evidence Act does not speak of the claim, but of the facts directly in issue in the previous case. The\nprevious case was in the Native Court, and as there are no pleadings, one must go by the substance as disclosed in the proceedings. The dispute was on title, and the\nultimate decision was against the plaintiffs on their basic cause of action, that they\n6\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n10/32\nwere the owners and grantors of the land occupied by the defendant; nor is it true that he raised the issue of title too late. The plaintiffs were debarred by that decision\nfrom claiming a declaration of title in a fresh case based on the same cause of action.\nThe following authorities were cited in the course of the hearing of the appeal: on the plaintiffs' behalf-\n(l) Spencer Bower on Res Judicata , which is not available in our library;\n(2) Halsbury's Laws of England (2nd Ed.) vol. 13 , paragraphs 466 and 488 , which is discussed and applied in\n(3) Commissioner of Lands v. Abraham and others , 19 N.L.R., 1, but that case differs from the present case;\n(4) Moss v. Anglo-Egyptian Navigation Co. , (1865), 1 Ch. App. Cas , which is included in a footnote in Halsbury to paragraph 488; and\n(5) Dedeke and others v. Williams and another, 10, W.A.C.A., 164, which is not relevant here. The defendant's counsel relied on Bell v. Holmes , (1956), 3 All E.R., 449 ,\nwhich is illuminating. The rule of res judicata is stated at page 454 from Ord v. Ord, (1923)2 K.B.432 , in these words-\nIf the res -the thing actually and directly in dispute has been already adjudicated, of course by a\n7\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n11/32\ncompetent Court, it cannot be litigated again.\nThe following sentence, quoted at page 455 from Hunter v. Stewart, (1861), 45 De G.F. & J. 168, at p. 178; 45 E.R. 1148 at p.1152, is also especially worth repeating-\nOne of the criteria of the identity of two suits, in considering a plea of res judicata, is the inquiry whether the same evidence would support both.\nIn both the former and the present suit in the Native Court the evidence given was on title, and the res adjudicated upon was the title of the plaintiffs to the land on\nwhich the defendant had his house.\nAlthough the competency of the Court in the former suit was not raised as a question at any stage in the present suit, or in the first argument of learned counsel for\nthe appellants under their ground of appeal, it arose incidentally in the course of the answer of the respondent's learned counsel at the hearing of the appeal, in\nconnection with the order made by the District Officer (Mr Grisman) who heard the first appeal from the Native Court and said this-\nI study the record and consider that Court should have called as Court's witnesses the two remaining subfamilies of Umuonala family. The case\n8\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/32\ncould be determined on the strength of their evidence without trying to compel the defendant to bring an action for title to the land in dispute. It is for the plaintiff to\nprove title, if anyone does. The appeal succeeds.\nI set aside the judgment of the Court below and order that the case be reopened to enable witnesses to be called from the other two sub-families of Umuonala.\n(The Native Court had been of opinion that the defendant should bring an action for title: the District Officer rightly said that it was for the plaintiff to prove title.) The\nsuggestion is that the subsequent proceedings in the Native Court were a nullity. They begin thus-\nThe Record of proceedings in the previous hearing read and interpreted before the hearing of the bench.\nThe District Officer's remarks also read.\n\"Q. by Court to plaintiff: What are the names of those two families whose evidence are required in this case?\nAns.: They are known as Umuonemum and Akpoadimora. \"1st wit. sworn states\" (He is a witness from one of the other sub-families).\nBefore discussing those portions of the record, I shall make some observations on jurisdiction and the competence of a Court.\n9\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/32\nPut briefly, a Court is competent when-\n(1) it is properly constituted as regards numbers and qualifications of the members of the bench, and no member is disqualified for one reason or another; and\n(2) the subject matter of the case is within its jurisdiction, and there is no feature in the case which prevents the Court from exercising its jurisdiction; and\n(3) the case comes before the Court initiated by due process of law, and upon fulfilment of any condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction.\nAny defect in competence is fatal, for the proceedings are a nullity however well conducted and decided: the defect is extrinsic to the adjudication.\nIf the Court is competent, the proceedings are not a nullity; but they may be attacked on the ground of irregularity in the conduct of the trial; the argument will be that\nthe irregularity was so grave as to affect the fairness of the trial and the soundness of the adjudication. It may turn out that the party complaining was to blame, or had\nacquiesced in the irregularity; or that it was trivial; in which case the appeal Court may not think fit to set aside the judgment. A defect in procedure is not always fatal.\n10\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n14/32\nTo revert to the\u00a0portions of record quoted above. The Native Court, instead of having a full re-hearing, had the evidence of the former witnesses read out, and heard\nonly witnesses from the other sub-families. That was a defect in procedure; neither party complained of it in the subsequent appeals. The re- hearing was not a nullity\non that account.\nIf it was a nullity, it would be, under condition (3) of the above statement on competence, on the ground that the District Officer's order, which initiated the re-hearing,\nwas bad in law. The order was in these terms-\nI set aside the judgment of the Court below and order that the case be re-opened to enable witnesses to be called from the other two sub-familites of Umuonala.\nIf that means that the re-hearing is to be confined to witnesses from those sub-families, the order is bad; if it means that there is to be a re-hearing for the sake of\nenabling such witnesses to be heard but does not confine it to them, it is not bad.\nIt may be suggested that the order is ambiguous and should be interpreted in the light of the paragraph which precedes it; but that is itself ambiguous and in my view\ncannot have any real weight. For my part I think\n11\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/32\nthat the order should be interpreted in the light of the maxim ut res magis valeat, and the second meaning, which saves the order, should be adopted. Moreover, it was\nso understood by the Native Court to which it was addressed: at the outset that Court had the former evidence read out, presumably as a method of incorporating it\nand of saving itself from hearing it again.\nI therefore think that the re-hearing was not a nullity. At the same time I should add that as the point arose incidentally ex improviso, it was not argued at all fully and no\ncases were cited. That is why I dealt with it without citing any cases. There are plenty of them, both local and English, and some day, if the point is raised in an appeal, it\nwill no doubt be better argued and decided.\nInterest reipublicae ut sit finis litium, is the reason behind res judicata. The parties have spent an inordinate amount of money over a piece of land of about 100 feet by\n50 at a village, and it is time that the litigation was at an end.\nThe following order is proposed:-\nThe appeal from the order of the High Court of the Eastern Region dated the 23rd November, 1959, in Appeal No. 0/35/A1959 of the Onitsha\n12\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/32\nJudicial Division, is dismissed, with costs to the respondent, which will be assessed after hearing the parties.\nLIONEL BRETT F.J. :\u00a0I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment which has been delivered by Bairamian, F.J., and that which is about to be delivered by Taylor,\nF.J., and I concur in the proposal to dismiss the appeal. I recognise the force of the argument that on their most natural interpretation the words used by the District\nOfficer in ordering the case to be \"re-opened\" amount to an order which he had no power to make, and that may well be the interpretation which he intended them to\nbear, but I agree with Bairamian, F.J., in the view that the words are capable of bearing the meaning which the Native Court in fact put upon them and which saves the\norder from invalidity, and I also agree that this Court will not be departing from the accepted principles of construction in holding that that is their true meaning.\nI would only add that if the order for the case to be re-opened was invalid it would follow from the decision of this Court in Ude v. Agu (1961) All N.L.R. 65, that the\norder setting aside the previous judgment of the Native Court was\n13\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/32\ninvalid also, since \"a naked power to set aside judgments is not provided for by Section 40\" of the former Native Courts Ordinance. Mr Shyngle did not submit that that\nprevious judgment constituted resjudicata in his favour, and on the view which I take of the effect of the order it is unnecessary for me to express an opinion on\nwhether the point would now be open to the appellants.\nJOHN IDOWU CONRAD TAYLOR, F.J. (Dissenting): The plaintiffs sued the defendant in the Native Court of Mbateghete for a declaration of title to land known as\n\"Aniuno-Isigwu\". In giving Judgment on the 11th August, 1958, the Court held as follows:-\nWe have every reason to believe that the land belongs to the plaintiffs. We therefore find the land for the plaintiffs because the title has now been proved beyond all\ndoubts.\nAgainst this Judgment the defendant appealed to the County Court Grade \"A\", which held as follows:-\nThe Plaintiffs/Respondents have made out their title case against the defendant-appellant but so far the defendant is occupying the compound land, we are awarding\nthe Plaintiffs/Respondents a Reversionary Title.\nA further appeal was lodged by the defendant to the Magistrate's Court holden\n14\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/32\nat Awka, and on the 23rd day of May, 1959, the Learned Magistrate confirmed the decision of the County Court and dismissed the appeal. Although the effect of a\nprevious Suit No. 33/56 in the previous proceedings was dealt with in the other Courts and evidence led about that Suit, it is in the Magistrate's Court that we find the\nlegal effect of that Suit dealt with. The Magistrate held, inter alia, that:-\nIt is also not correct that the matter is res judicata. The claim in the suit No. 33/56 was for recovery of Rent and the Administrative Officer with Resident's Judicial\nPowers found that plaintiff has failed to prove title to the land on which defendant has his house. On this and on some other grounds he dismissed the claim. The\nDeputy Governor condemned his judgment. It will be noted that he did not find that the land does not belong to the plaintiff; all he said was that the plaintiff failed to\nprove his title which in that case the plaintiff was not out to do.\nThe defendant appealed further to the High Court, which on the 23rd November, 1959, allowed the appeal and set aside the decisions of the Courts below. The Learned\nJudge on appeal held, inter alia,\n15\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/32\nthat:-\nThe Respondents base their claim to a declaration of title on the alleged tenancy; if they fail in proving a tenancy, they also fail in asserting their title; they have failed in\nproving the alleged tenancy because the issues decided in a suit as between the same parties are conclusive and cannot be a matter of further litigation between\nthem. (Outram v. Morewood, 3 East, 346, 355, 358, and Preistman v. Thomas, 9 P.D. 70, 210).\nThe judgment is not only conclusive with reference to the actual matter decided but to the grounds for the decision.\nThe plaintiffs have appealed to this Court from the Judgment of the High Court of the Onitsha Division. In addition to the general grounds of appeal against the\nevidence, two additional grounds were filed and argued with leave of this Court, and they read thus:-\n1. The Learned Judge misdirected himself when he said at page 39, line 19 of the record that \"the respondents base their claim to a declaration of title on the alleged\ntenancy; if they fail in proving a tenancy, they also fail in asserting their title;\"\n2. The Learned Judge in the Court below is wrong in law when he held that the issue of tenancy raised in the\n16\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/32\nMbateghete Native Court Suit 33/1956 is res judicata.\nI think it is important at the outset to look at Suit No. 33/56 and to decide what effect it has on the case on appeal before us. In that Suit the present appellants sued\nthe present respondent for the following:-\nRecovery of 195 yams, 13 fowls, 13 pots of palm wine and 13 Kola nuts being the customary land rental due from defendant for 13 years. The lease having been granted\nfor building purposes in 1941 out of which the defendant satisfied the conditions for 2 years only and has since failed. Total cash value of rental-\u252c\u00fa20.\nThe Native Court gave Judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of \u252c\u00fa20, being arrears of rent. There are other portions of the Judgment which deal with title to the area in\ndispute and which were the subject matter of adverse comment in later proceedings, but I do not for the moment consider them relevant for the point to which I am\nleading. This Judgment went on appeal before the District Officer. He heard it as an appeal and made the following order:-\nI study the record and consider that Court should have called as Court's witnesses the two remaining subfamilies of Umuonala\n17\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n21/32\nfamily. The case could be determined on the strength of their evidence without trying to compel defendant to bring an action for title to the land in dispute. It is for the\nplaintiff to prove title, if anyone does. The appeal succeeds.\n\"I set aside the judgment of the Court below and order that the case be reopened to enable witnesses to be called from the other two sub-families of Umuonala.''\u00a0\nThe case went back to the Native Court, and a Bench consisting of three out of the five Judges who delivered Judgment, and four who sat over the case when it began\non the 6th July, 1956, reopened the case on the 17th September, 1956, as ordered by the District Officer. On the 8th October, 1956, when further evidence was heard,\nthis Bench had increased to five. The record, when the case was reopened, reads as follows:-\nThe Record of proceedings in the previous hearing read and interpreted before the hearing of the bench.\nThe District Officer's remarks also read.\nQ. by Court to plaintiff: what are the names of those 2 families whose evidences are required in this case?\nAns. They are known as Umuonenum and Akpoadimora.\nThe witnesses were then called as well as some others called\n18\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/32\nby the Court, at the end of which the record reads as follows:-\nWe have reheard the case and also heard new witnesses produced....\nAt the hearing of this appeal I brought this matter to the notice of Mr Sofola for the respondent and Shyngle for the appellants, as I thought the order of the District\nOfficer was one he was not empowered by law to make and therefore a matter affecting his jurisdiction, It is true that a full dress argument did not develop on the\npoint. Mr Sofola contended that the proceedings in Suit 33/56 were not a nullity as the res was not affected. References were also made to Ss. 33 and 40 of the Native\nCourts Ordinance, Cap. 142, Vol. 4. of the 1948 Laws of Nigeria. Mr Shyngle on the other hand contended that once the District Officer had no power to send a case\nback for further evidence to be taken the whole proceedings are a nullity, and that that was a matter which could be taken in this appeal.\nI shall first deal with the question as to whether this was a matter that could be taken up by the Appeal Court itself. Order VII, Rule 2(6) of the Federal Supreme Court\nRules provides that:-\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions the Court in\n19\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/32\ndeciding the appeal shall not be confined to the grounds set forth by the appellant:\nProvided that the Court shall not if it allows the appeal appeal rest its decision on any ground not set forth by the appellant unless the respondent has had sufficient\nopportunity of contesting the cause on that ground.\nAs I said earlier in this judgment, Counsel for both sides were invited by me to adduce arguments on this point, and though there was no full dress argument, neither\nCounsel sought for an adjournment with a view to making preparations for a more detailed argument.\nThe Judgment of the Learned Judge in the Court below rests on the point that the decision in Suit 33/1956 is res judicata, and Learned Counsel for the appellants has\nfiled grounds of appeal attacking the judgment and the finding of res judicata. In my view if it becomes apparent on the record that a judgment which is relied on as\nresjudicata is in fact a nullity through excess or lack of Jurisdiction, it is the duty of Trial and an Appeal Court of its own motion to take up the point provided\nopportunity is given to both sides to adduce arguments on the issue.\n20\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/32\nIn the case of Westminister Bank Ltd. v. Edwards, (1942) A.C. 529, Viscount Simon, L.C., says this at page 533:-Moreover, the question was not in issue. There are of\ncourse, cases in which a Court should itself take an objection of its own, even though the point is not raised by any parties to it.\nAfter giving certain instances of when this may be done, the judgment continues thus:-\nAgain, a Court not only may, but should, take objection where the absence of jurisdiction is apparent on the face of the proceedings. Thus an appellate Court not only\nmay, but must, take objection that it has no jurisdiction to hear an appeal if it is apparent that no right of appeal exists.\nLord Wright, at page 536 of the same report, says this:-\nNow it is clear that a Court is not entitled but bound to put an end to proceedings if at any stage and by any means it becomes manifest that they are incompetent. It\ncan do so of its own initiative, even though the parties have consented to the irregularity, because as Willes, J., said in City of London Corporation v. Cox (3) in the\ncourse of giving the answers of the Judges to this House, \"mere acquiescence does not give jurisdiction.\"\n21\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/32\nIn Farquharson v. Morgan (4) Lord Halsbury states the principle thus:-\nIt has been long settled that, where an objection to the jurisdiction of an inferior Court appears on the face of the proceedings, it is immaterial by what means and by\nwhom the Court is informed of such objection. The Court must protect the prerogative of the Crown and the due course of the administration of Justice by prohibiting\nthe inferior Court from proceeding in matters as to which it is apparent that it has no jurisdiction.\nThat was a case of prohibition, but I think the general principle applies equally to the duty of the Court to take the objection when it becomes apparent in the course of\nproceedings before it in an appeal.\nThe words of Lord Wright in the passage to which I have referred are very strong indeed-\n\"at any stage and by any means\".\nI now turn to the order of the District Officer, for if he acted in excess of the jurisdiction given him by the Native Courts Ordinance, if he had no power to make the order\nwhich he in fact made, then that order is a nullity, and no matter what happened subsequently in the Native Court, no matter what the parties may have agreed upon,\nthe proceedings subsequent to the order are a nullity.\n22\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/32\nNow the power of the District Officer on hearing an appeal are contained in S.40 of the aforesaid Ordinance, which reads thus:-\nA Native Court of Appeal, a Magistrate's Court, the High Court, a District Officer, a Resident or the Governor in the exercise of his appellate jurisdiction under this\nOrdinance may-\n(a) after rehearing the whole case or not, make any such Order or pass any such Sentence as the Court of first instance could have made or passed in such cause or\nmatter\n;(b) order any such cause or matter to be reheard before the Court of first instance or before any other native Court or before any Magistrate's Court.\nIt is with S. 40 (b) that we are here concerned, for the District Officer never reheard the case. Was the order of the District Officer an order that the case should be\nreheard or was it an order sending the case back for certain witnesses to be heard? If it was the former, the order was perfectly valid; if the latter, it was invalid.\nIn the case of Timitimi v. Amabebe, 14 W.A.C.A. 374 at 377, Coussey J.A. said that:-\nThere is a distinction between an order or judgment which a Court is not competent to make and an order which, even if\n23\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/32\nerroneous in law or in fact, is within the Court's competency.\nIn my view the present case on appeal comes within the former. The Learned Justice of Appeal went on to say that where there is no jurisdiction the proceedings are\nvoid and are of no probative force between the parties.\nI have set out above the Order made by the District Officer, a person versed in the English language, though perhaps not a member of the Legal profession, and I cannot\nconvince myself that when one reads the whole of the Order as set out by me above, he meant anything other than, and was understood by the Court below as\nmeaning anything other than what he said, i.e. that the case should be reopened, not retried in toto, but reopened so as to enable certain witnesses to be called. This\norder is in my view a nullity, with the result that the subsequent proceedings to this order are also a nullity.\nI am grateful to my Lord BRETT, F.J., for the opportunity given me of reading the remarks which have just been made by him, particularly with respect to the decision of\nthis Court in Ude v. Agu (1961) All N.L.R. 65. I would humbly agree with the view that the whole of the order of the District\n24\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/32\nOfficer, and not just a portion of it, is invalid if the order to reopen is invalid. This would leave the Judgment of the Native Court of the 16th July, 1956, as the subsisting\nJudgment. As my Lord has said in his remarks, no reliance has been placed by Mr Shyngle on this Judgment as constituting res judicata. In my Judgment in determining\nthis appeal no help can be obtained from the proceedings in 33/56. They must be ignored. In my view, if the District Officer had no jurisdiction after setting aside a\nJudgment of the Native Court to order a case to be reopened for the purpose of allowing further witnesses to be called, then the order and the subsequent reopening\nof the case are a nullity, as are the subsequent appeals based on the case\nI have refrained from saying anything about the effect of the change in the composition of the Court for two reasons:(1) because arguments were not invited on the\npoint, it not having been noticed at the hearing, and\n(2) the point on which argument was invited is sufficient to dispose of Appeal No. 33/56. That being the case, can the Judgment of the Judge on Appeal, based as it\nwas on the finding that the Judgment in Appeal\n25\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n29/32\nNo. 33/56 operated as res judicata, stand? In my view it cannot. Mr Shyngle for the appellants has argued that there are concurrent findings of fact of three Courts in\nfavour of the appellants, and has asked this Court to confirm the decision of the Magistrate to which I have already referred. This conclusion is inescapable, for the\nLearned Judge on Appeal in the High Court did not deal with the facts of the case. The Learned Counsel for the respondent has put his arguments on the issue of res\njudicata and nothing else.\nFor these reasons I beg to differ from the majority Judgment delivered by My Lord, BAIRAMIAN, F.J. I would allow the appeal, set aside the Judgment of the High Court\nand restore that of the Magistrate. I would award the appellants the costs of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\n26\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n30/32\nShyngle (with him, Onyekwuluje)\nFor Appellant(s)\nSofola\nFor Respondent(s)\nAppearances:\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/32\n5/8/25, 10:45 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/32"}, {"filename": "C.B.N and Another v Aribo (SC.9_2011) [2017] NGSC 1 (11 May 2017) - NigeriaLII.pdf", "case_title": "C.B.N & ANOR V.

Ltd. Sometime in 2002\nthe 1st appellant (the Central Bank of Nigeria -CBN) revoked the bank's licence to conduct foreign\nexchange transactions when it was discovered that it was selling foreign exchange in breach of laid\ndown procedures. The bank was also penalised in the sum of N293.129 million. As a result, the bank's\nboard of directors advised the respondent and two other employees to resign their appointments. The\nrespondent accordingly tendered his letter of resignation on 10th October 2002.\nThe 1st appellant set up a Special Board Committee to look into the foreign exchange transactions of\nthe bank. Based on the report, the 1st appellant advised the bank to terminate the employment of the\nrespondent and other employees found to be complicit in the illegal foreign exchange transactions. The\n1st appellant deemed the actions of the respondent and other affected employees to constitute serious\nmisconduct, which entitled the bank under Section 44(2)(d) of the Banks and Other Financial Institutions\nAct 1991 (BOFIA) (as amended) (now Section 48(2)(d) of the Banks and other Financial Institutions Act\nCap. B3, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004) to blacklist him. His appointment was accordingly\nterminated vide a letter dated 5th February, 2003. Consequently he instituted an action before the\nFederal High Court vide suit no. FHC/L/CS/163/2003 coram Abutu, J against Equity Bank as 1st\ndefendant and the Central Bank of Nigeria (1st appellant) as 2nd defendant challenging the termination\nof his appointment for the purpose of blacklisting him under Section 44(4) of BOFIA (now Section 48(4)\nof BOFIA, LFN 2004) even though the bank had accepted his letter of resignation and had paid him his\nentitlements. The bank had purported to reject the letter of resignation with a letter of termination.\nAbutu, J. entered judgment in the respondent's favour as follows:\n\u00001. It is declared that the Plaintiff not having been dismissed and his appointment not having been\nterminated for reasons of fraud, dishonesty or conviction for an offence involving fraud or dishonesty,\nthe 2nd defendant cannot invoke the provisions of Section 44 (4) of the Banks and other Financial\nInstitutions Act, 1991 (as amended) against the plaintiff to blacklist him.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0It is further declared that the 1st defendant having accepted the resignation of the plaintiff and\npaid him his entitlements cannot subsequently validly terminate the appointment of the plaintiff.\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:12 PM\nC.B.N and Another v Aribo (SC.9/2011) [2017] NGSC 1 (11 May 2017) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2017/1/eng@2017-05-11\n2/10\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The 1st defendant's letter dated 5th February 2003 for the termination of the appointment of the\nplaintiff is hereby declared null and void and of no effect. The said letter is hereby set aside.\"\nAfter the success of the action, the respondent sought employment in other financial institutions. He\nwas unsuccessful because, having regard to his position as a management staff in the banking industry,\nhe required clearance from the CBN before any bank or financial institution could employ him. The 1st\nappellant refused to grant the clearance on the ground that he had been blacklisted.\nIn an attempt to overcome this roadblock, he instituted a fresh action against the appellants herein by\nway of originating summons filed on 31/3/2008 before the Federal High Court, Lagos (the trial court)\nvide suit no. FHC/L/CS/305/2008. He sought the following reliefs:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A mandatory order directing the defendants, particularly the 2nd defendant to de-blacklist the\nplaintiff and to delete his name from the list of blacklisted persons.\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0An order directing the defendants, particularly the 2nd defendant to comply with the declaration of\nHon. Justice D.D. Abutu in the judgment delivered on 11/4/2005.\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0An order directing the defendants, particularly the 2nd defendant, to notify the plaintiff in writing\n[of] the removal of his name from the blacklisted list.\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0An order for payment of exemplary and aggravated damages in the sum of N40, 000, 000.00 for\nloss of employment and earnings from 2005 to date of judgment in this suit.\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The cost of this suit.\u0094\n\u00a0\nThe following documents were attached to the supporting affidavit:\ni.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Exhibit DM1 - Certified True Copy of the Judgment of Abutu, J. dated 11/4/2005;\nii.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Exhibit DM2 - Respondent's letter of appeal to the 2nd appellant dated 28/7/2005;\niii.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Exhibit DM3 - 2nd appellant's letter dated 19/9/2005 notifying the respondent that his name had\nbeen blacklisted; and\niv.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Exhibit DM4 - Respondent's solicitor's letter dated 26/9/2005 to the 2nd appellant.\nThe appellants filed a counter affidavit in opposition to the summons.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing and relying on the findings of Abutu, J. in Exhibit DM1, the trial court\nper Hon. Justice Okechukwu J. Okeke, in a considered judgment delivered on 14/7/2008, upheld the\nblacklisting of the respondent. In reaching his decision, His Lordship relied on findings made by Abutu\nJ. in Exhibit DM1 to the effect that the respondent was indicted in the report of the Special Board\nCommittee tendered before him which found him guilty of foreign exchange malpractices. The\nrespondent was dissatisfied with the decision and filed an appeal before the lower court. He formulated\n3 issues for determination. In its judgment delivered on 22/3/2010 the court struck out two of the\nissues formulated on the ground that they did not arise from the decision of the trial court. It allowed\nthe appeal in part as follows:\n\"I set aside the decision of the learned trial Judge on the 14/7/08 in respect of reliefs 1 & 3 on the\nOriginating Summons. In its place, I order that the name of the Appellant be de-blacklisted by the\nrespondent I award costs ofN30, 000.00 in favour of the Appellant.\"\nThe appellants are dissatisfied with the part of the judgment directing that the respondent's name be\nde-blacklisted, hence the instant appeal. The parties duly filed and exchanged their respective briefs in\ncompliance with the rules of this court. At the hearing of the appeal on 20th February, 2017, ELUBODE\nB. OMOBORIOWO ESQ. adopted and relied on the appellant's brief filed on 26/2/2013, settled by CHIEF\nTUNDE OLOJO, in urging the court to allow the appeal, A.M. MAKINDE ESQ. leading Messrs S.J.\nODUMOSU and M. GAMBO, adopted the respondent's brief filed on 15/5/13, settled by him, urging the\ncourt to dismiss the appeal.\nThe appellants formulated 2 issues for the determination of the appeal as follows:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Whether the appellants were entitled to rely on the findings of fact in an earlier judgment in the\nlater action as a defence in the later action?\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Whether there was sufficient evidence before the Court of Appeal to justify the reversal of the\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:12 PM\nC.B.N and Another v Aribo (SC.9/2011) [2017] NGSC 1 (11 May 2017) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2017/1/eng@2017-05-11\n3/10\ndecision of the trial court and consequently grant of the relief of de-blacklisting sought by the\nrespondent?\nThe respondent also identified 2 issues for determination thus:\n1.

I shall adopt the issues formulated by\nthe appellants is determining the appeal.\nIssue 1\nWhether the appellants were entitled to rely on the findings of fact in an earlier judgment in the later\naction as a defence in the later action?\nThis issue is the same as the respondent's issue 2.\nLearned counsel for the appellant commenced his submissions by contending that the finding of the\nlower court to the effect that the parties did not plead estoppel or res judicata is not supported by the\nevidence before that court. He noted that the case before the trial court was predicated mainly on the\njudgment of Abutu, 3. in FHC/L/CS/163/2003 exhibited by the respondent as Exhibit DM1 in support of\nhis originating summons, as his complaint was that the appellants had failed to comply with the said\njudgment. He submitted that a judgment includes not only the conclusion reached therein but also the\nfindings of fact upon which the conclusion is based. He referred to the definition of \"decision\" as stated\nin Section 318 (1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended). He\nalso referred to the definition of \"finding of fact\" as contained in Black's Law Dictionary, 7th edition, to\nwit: \"a determination by a Judge, Jury or administrative agency of a fact supported by evidence on\nrecord usually presented.at a trial or hearing\", and submitted that a finding of fact contained in a\njudgment qualifies as a decision of that court, which remains subsisting until set aside. He submitted\nthat in the course of the hearing of the originating summons, learned counsel for the appellants\nidentified salient findings of Abutu, J. in Exhibit DM1 and related them to the issues in contention in the\nsuit before Okeke, J. He contended that the averments in the counter affidavit and the submissions of\nlearned counsel raised the principle of issue estoppel. That issue estoppel need not be pleaded in any\nparticular form so long as the matters constituting estoppel are stated in such a manner as to show that\nthe party relies on it as a defence or answer. He relied on: Alakija & Ors. Vs Abdullai (1998) 6 NWLR\n(Pt.552) 1 @ 15 A - B. He urged the court to find and hold that the parties duly raised and argued the\nissue of issue estoppel/res judicata.\nHe argued further that even if the court does not agree that the parties raised issue estoppel, the\njudgment in Exhibit DM1 remains relevant and binding on the parties by virtue of Section 174 (1) & (2)\nof the Evidence Act 2011. He submitted that the lower court correctly stated the principle that evidence\nin an earlier case cannot be relied upon in a later case but erroneously went on to hold that while the\nfinal decision of Abutu, J. could constitute evidence by producing his judgment, the evidence led\ntherein could not be relied upon by the court in another case to grant the reliefs sought on a different\ncause of complaint. He submitted that the principles were misapplied in the circumstances of this case,\nhaving regard to the fact that the respondent had approached the trial court seeking an order\ncompelling the appellants to obey the decision reached in Exhibit DM1. He submitted that Exhibit DM1\ncontained several findings of fact and considerations of the law from which a conclusion was finally\ndrawn and that the appellants relied on those findings of fact and not the evidence. He referred to\nparagraph 6 of the appellants' counter affidavit at pages 35 - 36 of the record.\nIn addition to Section 174 (1) and (2) of the Evidence Act, he also relied on sections 59 and 173 to\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:12 PM\nC.B.N and Another v Aribo (SC.9/2011) [2017] NGSC 1 (11 May 2017) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2017/1/eng@2017-05-11\n4/10\nbuttress his submission that a judgment is conclusive proof of what it decides. He submitted that where\na party relies on a judgment against which he has not appealed, he is deemed to rely on every part of\nthe judgment including the findings leading to the ultimate conclusion reached. He submitted that the\nrespondent was not entitled to rely on the aspects of the judgment favourable to him and jettison\nthose parts which are not. He referred to: A.C.B. Pic. Vs Losada (Nig.) Ltd. (1995) 7 NWLR (Pt.405) 26 @\n53 D. On the effect of a judgment not appealed against he relied on: K.T. & Ind. Pic. Vs The Tugboat\n\"M/V JAPAUL B\" (2011) 9 NWLR (Pt.1251) 133 @ 157 B - G. He submitted further that the questions\nraised by the respondent in the earlier suit were fully decided by Abutu, 1 in Exhibit DM1 and the trial\ncourt was therefore entitled to rely on the findings therein. He contended that to act otherwise would\nhave amounted to Abutu, J. sitting on appeal over the decision of a court of concurrent jurisdiction. He\nrelied on: Okoye Vs Nigerian Furniture Co. Ltd. (1991) 6 NWLR (Pt.199) 501 @ 538 C - D. He urged the\ncourt to resolve this issue in favour of the appellants.\nIn reaction to the above submissions, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the cause of\naction in the two suits before the Federal High Court were different and that the trial court was wrong\nto have relied on the judgment in Exhibit DM1 in reaching its decision. He contended that while the\nissue before Abutu, J. was the termination of the respondent's employment bordering on Section 44(4)\nof BOFIA and the threat to blacklist him, the issue in the later suit before Okeke, J. was the blacklisting\nof the respondent under Section 44(2)(d) of BOFIA which, in his view, is a completely different issue. He\nsubmitted that the court below was right in upholding the respondent's contention that the learned\ntrial Judge was in error to have relied on the findings of Abutu, J. in Exhibit DM1 to the effect that the\nrespondent was involved in illegal foreign exchange transactions when the Special Committee Report\nwas not before him. He relied on the case of: David Itauma Vs Akpe Ime (2000) 12 NWLR (Pt.680) 156.\nHe stoutly rejected the contention of learned counsel for the appellants that a finding of fact may\nqualify as a decision of the court. He posited that the evidence led in the suit before Abutu, J. could not\nbe relied upon as evidence in the suit before the learned trial Judge, having regard to the fact that the\ncause of action before Okeke, J. arose after the decision of Abutu, J. upon the issuance of the letter of\nde-listing to the respondent by the appellants.\nHe submitted that learned counsel for the appellants misapplied the provisions of Section 174 (1) and\n(2) of the Evidence Act, as the facts and circumstances of this case and the issues before Abutu, J. were\nnot the same and therefore could not constitute issue estoppel between the parties and the findings of\nAbutu, J. could not constitute evidence in the instant case. While conceding that an appellate court is\nusually reluctant to set aside the findings of fact made by a trial court, he submitted that the findings in\nthe instant case were rightly set aside by the lower court, as the findings were perverse, the trial court\nhaving taken into account matters which it ought not to have taken into account. He also contended\nthat the findings of the trial court ran counter to the evidence before it. He relied on: Yaro Vs Arewa\nConstruction Ltd. (2007) 17 NWLR (Pt.1063) 333.\nIn resolving this issue, I am of the view that it is necessary to determine what is meant by the phrase\n\"findings of fact/' Black's Law Dictionary, 8th edition defines it as:\n\"A determination by a judge, jury or administrative agency of a fact supported by the evidence in the\nrecord, usually presented at the trial or hearing.\"\nThis court in the case of Egbe Vs Adefarasin (1987) 1 NWLR (Pt.47) 1 @ 20 F - H gave further elucidation\non the issue as follows:\n\"A finding is a result of deliberations of a jury or a court. It is a decision upon a question of fact reached\nas a result of judicial examination or investigation by a court, jury, referee, coroner, etc. It is more\nappropriately called a finding of fact and as the name implies it is a determination from the evidence of\na case concerning facts averred by one side and denied by the other side. Findings of fact are the\nresults of reasoning from evidentiary facts. They are conclusions drawn by the court from the facts\nwithout the application of law or exercise of legal judgment. A trial court must first find the facts or\nmake appropriate Findings of fact on the issues in dispute before applying the relevant and applicable\nlaw. Findings of fact fall within the peculiar preserve of the trial Judge. Conclusions or inference from\nthose facts can be drawn by any court, including appellate courts: See: Bannmax Vs Austin Motor Auto\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:12 PM\nC.B.N and Another v Aribo (SC.9/2011) [2017] NGSC 1 (11 May 2017) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2017/1/eng@2017-05-11\n5/10\nCo. Ltd. (1955) A.C. 370 at page 375; (1955) 1 All ER 326 at pp. 327/328.\"\n\u00a0\nSee also: Fointrades Ltd. Vs Universal Association Co. Ltd. (20021 8 NWLR (Pt.770) 699: Edosa & Anor. Vs\nOaiemwanre (2010) LPELR-8618 (C/A).\nThus findings of fact are made by a trial Judge after carefully reviewing the evidence before the court\nand conclusions or inferences can be drawn from those facts by any court. It is settled law that an\nappellate court is always loth to interfere with findings of fact made by a trial court unless the decision\nof the court is shown to be unreasonable, perverse, not supported by the evidence or where such\ndecision is not the result of a genuine exercise of judicial discretion and has resulted in a miscarriage of\njustice. See: Kodilinye Vs Odu (1935) 2 WACA 336: Yesufu Vs Adama (2010) 5 NWLR (Pt.1188) 522. The\nlaw is also settled that a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction is valid and subsisting unless set\naside by an appellate court. It follows therefore that a vital finding of fact upon which a judgment is\npredicated, which is not appealed against remains intact. It remains valid and binding on the parties.\nSee: Kraus Thompson Org. Ltd.

(2014) LPELR-22184 (SC) @ 47 C - F.\n\u00a0\nNow, in the originating summons that led to this appeal, the respondent specifically sought an order\n\"directing the defendant, particularly the 2nd defendant to comply with the judgment of Hon. Justice\nD.D. Abutu in the judgment delivered on 11th April, 2005.\" The judgment was annexed to the affidavit\nin support as Exhibit DM1. In a trial on originating summons, the averments in the affidavit in support\nand the exhibits annexed thereto constitute the evidence upon which the court will rely in reaching its\ndecision. In paragraph 9 of the affidavit in support the respondent averred that there was no appeal\nfiled against the judgment by the 1st defendant i.e. the 1st appellant herein. It is also evident that\nhaving obtained judgment in his favour, the respondent was satisfied with the judgment in all respects\nand did not deem it necessary to appeal against any of the findings made. Thus the judgment delivered\nby Abutu, 1 in suit no. FHC/L/CS/163/2003 is valid, subsisting and binding on the parties thereto.\nHis Lordship, Okeke, J.made some findings based on Exhibit DM1 as follows:\n\"On page 16 of Exhibit DM1, Honourable Justice D.D. Abutu held thus: -\n\u0000The evidence on both sides, which I accept is that the plaintiff was an employee of the 1st defendant\nand that the plaintiff took part in the foreign exchange transactions in respect of which the 1st\ndefendant was penalised in the sum of N293.129 million for illegal foreign exchange transactions and\nits dealership licence suspended indefinitely.\n\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085.\nExhibit 2 is the 2nd defendants query letter to the plaintiff. The plaintiff's reply to Exhibit 2 is Exhibit 7.\nExhibit 9 is the minute of the Special Board Committee before which the plaintiff admittedly appeared\nand Exhibit 10 is the report of the committee wherein the plaintiff. Messrs Kalu and Adegboye were\nadjudged guilty of forex malpractices. The evidence is that notwithstanding the findings of the\ncommittee that the three officers were guilty of malpractices, the 1st defendant merely advised them to\nresign.\"\nIt is not in dispute that the plaintiff herein and its (sic) erstwhile employer, Equity Bank of Nigeria\nLimited were involved in foreign exchange transactions for which the Central Bank of Nigeria can\nimpose sanctions. Equity Bank of Nigeria Limited (plaintiff's erstwhile employer) was penalised in the\nwhopping sum of N293,129 million and its dealership licence suspended indefinitely. It is my humble\nview the plaintiff's involvement in the illegal foreign exchange is serious misconduct in relation to his\nduties while in the services of Equity Bank of Nigeria Ltd. It is also my view that the condonation of the\nplaintiff's serious misconduct in the illegal foreign exchange transactions by a fellow culprit is no bar to\nthe Central Bank of Nigeria exercising its power to sanction the plaintiff.\" (Underlining supplied for\nemphasis)\n\u00a0\nThe court below rejected the findings above on the following grounds:\na.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0That the learned trial Judge should not have arrived at his decision on the respondent's \u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:12 PM\nC.B.N and Another v Aribo (SC.9/2011) [2017] NGSC 1 (11 May 2017) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2017/1/eng@2017-05-11\n6/10\ninvolvement in illegal foreign exchange transactions without looking at the Special Committee Report.\nb.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0That in the absence of the report there was insufficient evidence upon which the court could have\ndecided whether or not to grant the prayer to. de-blacklist him or not.\nc.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0That the decision of Abutu, J. was not based on the issue of illegal transactions.\nd.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0That the parties did not plead issue estoppel or res judicata.\nIt should be reiterated that it was the respondent who exhibited and relied upon the judgment of\nAbutu, J. in FHC/L/CS/163/2003 as part of his evidence in the suit, in support of his prayer for an order\nof the court directing the defendants to comply therewith among other reliefs. As can be seen from the\nexcerpt of the judgment of Abutu, J. reproduced in the judgment of Okeke, J., His Lordship considered\nthe entirety of the evidence before him, which he accepted, before arriving at the final decision made in\nthat suit. In concluding the judgment he held thus:\n\"The misconduct of the plaintiff arising from the illegal foreign exchange transactions for which the\nplaintiff was adjudged guilty by the committee set up by the board of the 1st defendant in this case\nappears to have been condoned by the 1st defendant. I hold that the plaintiff validly resigned his\nappointment.\"\nThe decision was based on findings of fact, which have not been appealed against. The findings were\nreferred to and relied upon by the appellants in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of their counter affidavit to the\noriginating summons at pages 35 - 36 of the record wherein it was averred as follows:\n\"5. That further to the averments in paragraph 4 thereof, while it is true to state that the honourable\nCourt kept within the scope of the issues before it, it is clear that after considering the evidence at the\ntrial and the arguments of all counsel, the court further held that any bank officer who has been found\nguilty of misconduct in relation to his duties, can be validly blacklisted by the CBN.\n6.\u00a0 The trial court specifically found as FACTS the following: -\n(i) that the Plaintiff appeared before a Board Committee set up to investigate illegal foreign exchange\ntransactions by Foreign Exchange Documentation Department of which he, the plaintiff, was Head;\n(ii) that the said committee submitted a report which found the (three) officials, including the plaintiff,\nguilty of misconduct in relation to their duties;\n(iii) that the trial court held the Committee's report as having adjudged the plaintiff guilty of\nmisconduct arising from the illegal foreign exchange transactions;\n(iv)\u00a0\u00a0 that the Central Bank of Nigeria can invoke the provisions of Section 44 (2) (d) of BOFIA to\n\"blacklist\" a bank officer who has been found guilty of misconduct in relation to his duties;\n(v) that the plaintiffs resignation was not voluntary but induced by his employers following the\nCommittees report of his misconduct, thus foisting a stalemate and state of helplessness and inability of\nthe plaintiff to retain his job and/or sustain his career any further.\n7. That the plaintiff has not appealed against any of the above findings of the trial court.\"\nThose findings are quite damning. There is no appeal against them. They remain binding on the parties\nuntil set aside by an appellate court. Both judgments are judgments of the Federal High Court. His\nLordship Okeke, J., in the absence of any appeal against the judgment of Abutu, J. could not have done\notherwise than adopt the findings and conclusions made therein since he was being called upon to\ndirect the defendants to comply with it.\nSection 174 (1) & (2) of the Evidence Act, 2011 provides:\n\u0000174 (1) If a judgment is not pleaded by way of estoppel, it is as between the parties and privies\ndeemed to be a relevant fact, whenever any matter, which was or might have been decided in the\naction in which it is given, is in issue or is deemed to be relevant to the issue in any subsequent\nproceeding.\n(2) Such judgment is conclusive proof of the facts which it decides, or might have decided, if the party\nwho gives evidence of it had no opportunity of pleading it as an estoppel.\"\n\u00a0\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:12 PM\nC.B.N and Another v Aribo (SC.9/2011) [2017] NGSC 1 (11 May 2017) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2017/1/eng@2017-05-11\n7/10\nSuit No. FHC/L/CS/163/2003 before Abutu, J. was predicated on the respondent's contention that\nhaving accepted his letter of resignation and paid his entitlements, which had determined the\nmaster/servant relationship between him and Equity Bank of Nig. Ltd., the bank was not entitled to.\nterminate his appointment. The reliefs sought in the statement of claim are reproduced in Exhibit DM1.\nHe sought, inter alia, a declaration against the 2nd defendant (1st appellant herein) that he had not\nbreached any of the provisions of the Banks and other Financial Institutions Act 1991 and a declaration\nthat the 2nd defendant could not rely on the purported letter of termination dated 5th February, 2003\nto blacklist him under Section 44(4) of BOFIA, having resigned his appointment on 10th October, 2002.\nThe section provides:\n\"44 (4) Any person whose appointment with a bank been terminated or who has been dismissed for\nreasons of fraud, dishonesty or conviction for an offence involving dishonesty or fraud shall not be\nemployed by any bank in Nigeria.\"\nAt the trial before Abutu, J, the respondent had contended that he was not aware of the reason for his\ndisengagement, that he was not aware that the committee produced a report containing findings and\nrecommendations and he denied being indicted by the committee. In its defence the 2nd defendant\nrelied on Exhibit 9, the proceedings of the committee, which showed that the respondent participated\nin the proceedings and Exhibit 10, the report of the committee, which indicted the respondent and two\nother officers. After considering the evidence led by both sides the court found and held that the report\nshowed that the respondent was guilty of serious misconduct arising from illegal foreign. exchange\ntransactions. In order to determine the circumstances and legal effect of the respondent's resignation\nvis a vis the subsequent purported termination, the court had to consider the facts that gave rise to it. It\nfound that the resignation was not voluntary. That the respondent was compelled to resign as a result\nof his indictment by the committee. The learned trial Judge frowned at the fact that the illegal activity\nwas apparently condoned since the respondent was merely asked to resign. It however concluded, as\nstated earlier, that having accepted his resignation the defendants could no longer terminate his\nappointment.\nThe respondent contends that the issues in FHC/L/CS/163/2003 are not the same as in\nFHC/L/CS/205/2008 as the former was predicated on the provisions of Section 44(4) of BOFIA while the\nlatter arose from facts that occurred after the judgment of Abutu, J. and was predicated on Section\n44(2)(d) of the Act. Sections 44(1) & (2)(d) of the Act provide:\n\"44. (1) Every bank shall, before appointing any director or chief executive, seek and obtain the Bank's\nwritten approval for the proposed appointment.\n(2) No person shall be appointed or shall remain a director, secretary or an officer of a bank who\n(d)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is guilty of serious misconduct in relation to his duties.\"\nBy Section 1(1) of the Act, \"the Bank\" (as underlined) means the Central Bank of Nigeria.\nIssue estoppel arises in a subsequent suit when the issue involved in the later suit has been raised and\ndistinctly determined in a previous suit between the same parties or their privies. The decision relied\nupon for the plea of estoppel must be final and the parties must be the same. See: Anwoyi Vs Sodeke\n(2006)13 NWLR (Pt.996) 34: Udo Vs Obot (1989) 1 NWLR (Pt.951) 59, Issue estoppel may arise where a\nplea of res judicata could not be established because the causes of action are not the same. See:\nAdedayo Vs Babalola (1995) 7 NWLR (Pt.408) 383 where this court at pages 402 H and 405 B - C held:\n\"Even if the objects .of the first and second actions are different, as in the instant case, the finding on a\nmatter which came directly in issue in the first action - whether the Agbonbifa family is a ruling family\nfor the purpose of the Elesie Chieftaincy Stool - was embodied in the earlier decision.

The 1st appellant and the respondent were parties to both suits. The 2nd appellant\nherein is a privy of the 1st appellant. The circumstances of the respondent's resignation from Equity\nBank of Nigeria Limited were specifically in issue in that suit and finally determined by Abutu, J. The\ngeneral rule is that a plea of estoppel must be specifically pleaded. However, it is not necessary to plead\nit in any particular form so long as the facts constituting estoppel are stated in such a manner as to\nshow that the party pleading relies on it as a defence or answer. See: Alakija Vs Abdulai (1998) 6 NWLR\n(Pt.552) 1 (5) 15 A - B: Ezewani Vs Onwordi (1986) 4 NWLR (Pt.33) 27. Suit no.

STANBIC IBTC PLC\nJUDGMENT\nBIOBELE ABRAHAM GEORGEWILL JCA: My lords, this appeal is predicated on the garnishee orders\nabsolute made by the Federal High Court Lagos Division, Coram: Archibong J., on the application of the\n1st - 5th Respondents for the enforcement of the judgment entered in their favor by the court below\ndelivered on 25/7/2011 in Suit No. FHC/L/CS/35/2008: Musical Society of Nigeria Ltd/GTE & Ors V.\nNigeria Copyright Commission & Ors. The Appellants had appealed both against the said judgment on\nwhich the garnishee orders absolute was made as well as garnishee orders absolute. It follows that the\nsuccess or failure of the appeal against the said judgment would have a definitive effect on the\noutcome of this appeal in one way or the other.\nThe effect of the judgment in the appeal against the judgment of the court below if successful and\nallowed would have the effect of automatically rendering this appeal successful too since in law there\ncan be no enforcement of non existing judgment. In other words, without a valid judgment there can be\nno enforcement or execution of such a judgment by whatever legal means possible to a judgment\ncreditor, including by garnishee proceedings. On the other hand, if the appeal against the said\njudgment fails and is dismissed, then the effect would be to render this appeal competent to be\ndetermined on its merit in line with the issues so assiduously canvassed in their respective briefs of the\nparties.\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:08 PM\nNigerian Copyright Commission and Others v Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria LTD/GTE (CA/L/692/12) [2017] NGCA 1 (8 J\u2026\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngca/2017/1/eng@2017-06-08\n2/7\nNow, by the judgment of the court below delivered on 25/7/2011, the Appellants were found liable in\ndamages to the 1st - 5th Respondents in the total sum of N40, 000,000. 00 as a result of the finding by\nthe court below that the Appellants breached the fundamental rights of the 1st - 5th Respondents. The\nAppellants filed their Notice of Appeal on 8/9/2011. Subsequently, the Appellants applied for and\nobtained an order of the court below on 6/12/2011 staying the execution of the said judgment.\nHowever, on 15/12/2011, the 1st - 5th Respondents filed an application seeking to set aside the order\nof stay of execution on the ground that the court below lacked the jurisdiction to grant a stay of\nexecution after the appeal has been entered in this court against its judgment in Appeal No.\nCA/L/925/2011. On 27/3/2012, the court below acceded to the request of the 1st - 5th Respondents\nand accordingly discharged its earlier order of stay of execution of its judgment granted in favor of the\nAppellants. See pages 1- 20, 28, 50 and 65 of the Record of Appeal.\nOn 27/3/2012, the Appellants proceeded to file before this court a motion seeking an order of stay of\nthe said judgment pending the determination of the appeal against the said judgment. The motion was\nduly served on the 1st - 5th Respondents firstly on 27/3/2012 and again on 5/4/2012.\nThe Registrar of the court below was also served with the motion for stay of execution on 29/3/2012.\nOn 12/6/2012, the 1st - 5th Respondents filed their counter affidavit to the said motion for stay before\nthis court, which was served on the Appellants on 13/6/2012. The motion for stay was already fixed for\nhearing by this court on 13/6/2012. See pages 61, 160 - 161, 162 - 163, 164 - 165, 166, and 169 of the\nRecord of Appeal.\nIn the meantime, while these processes were pending before this court, the 1st - 5 Respondents\nproceeded to the court below and on 11/4/212 filed an application for the enforcement of the said\njudgment by means of garnishee proceedings and on 21/5/2012, the court below granted an order of\ngarnishee nisi. Subsequently, the various garnishee banks filed their affidavit to show cause on\n21/6/2012 and on 25/6/2012, the court below heard the matter and made the garnishee order absolute\nin respect of some of the garnishee banks. It is this garnishee orders absolute that is thus the subject\nmatter of this appeal filed on 28/6/2012, on which date the Appellants also filed a motion for the stay\nof execution of the garnishee orders absolute. See pages 67, 100, 105 - 144, 146 - 157, 170 - 185, 186 -\n188, 230 - 239 and 242 of the Record of Appeal.\nThis is thus an appeal against the garnishee orders absolute made by the Federal High Court, Lagos\nDivision, Coram: Archibong J in Suit No: FHC/L/CS/35/2008: Musical Society of Nigeria Ltd/GTE & Ors V.\nNigeria Copyright Commission & Ors on 25/6/2012 at pages 200 - 224 of the Record of Appeal.\nThe Appellants were peeved with the said garnishee orders absolute and had filed their Notice of\nAppeal on 4 Grounds of Appeal on 28/6/2012 at pages 239A - 239D of the Record of Appeal. The\nRecord of Appeal was duly transmitted to this court on 21/9/2012. The Appellants' brief was filed on\n4/2/2014. The 1st - 5th Respondents' brief was filed on 6/4/2017.\nAt the hearing of the Appeal on 16/5/2017, Olumide Ekisola Esq., with Mrs. Vivian Ayo - Okhiria, learned\ncounsel for the 1st - 5th Respondents adopted the Respondents' brief as their argument and urged the\ncourt to dismiss the appeal and to affirm the garnishee orders absolute. The Appellants, though duly\nserved with hearing notice for the 16/5/2017 through their counsel on 4/5/2017 and with the\nRespondents' brief on 11/4/2017, were not represented by counsel and the Appellants' brief was\ndeemed as argued pursuant to Order 19 Rule 9(4) of the Court of Appeal Rules 2016\nHowever, on the invitation of this court, on 19/5/2017 the parties through their respective counsel; Obi\nEzeilo Esq., with Mrs. Lynda Alpheaus for the Appellants and Olumide Ekisola Esq., with Mrs. Vivian Ayo -\nOkhiria and Innocent Eboh Esq,, for the 1st - 5th Respondents, addressed the court on an issue raised\nsuo motu by the court on the locus standi of the 1st Respondent.\nISSUES FOR DETERMINATION\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:08 PM\nNigerian Copyright Commission and Others v Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria LTD/GTE (CA/L/692/12) [2017] NGCA 1 (8 J\u2026\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngca/2017/1/eng@2017-06-08\n3/7\nIn the Appellants' brief, the following four issues were distilled as arising for determination in this\nappeal, namely:\n1. Whether the Court below could grant the garnishee order nisi and the garnishee order absolute when\nthe Court is aware that there is a pending motion for stay of execution of its judgment at the Court of\nAppeal. (Distilled from Ground 1)\n2. Whether the Court below could make the garnishee order absolute without first hearing and\ndetermining the affidavit and written address to show cause filed by the Appellants/Judgment debtors\nand reaching a finding therein. (Distilled from Ground 2)\n3. Whether the Court below could, in making the garnishee order absolute, attach any other monies in\nthe account of the 1st Appellant other than monies in the general funds account of the Is' Appellant.\n(Distilled from Ground 3)\n4. Whether the consent of the Attorney General of the Federation is required before a judgment against\nthe 1st Appellant could be executed since the 1st Appellant is a Federal Government Agency. (Distilled\nfrom Ground 4)\nIn the 1st - 5th Respondents' brief, the following four issues were distilled as arising for determination\nin this appeal, namely:\n1. Whether the court below was right to have heard and determined the garnishee proceedings duly\ninitiated before it despite the fact that there was a motion for stay of execution filed at the Appellate\ncourt, more so when the counsel for the Appellant did not call the lower's court attention to the\nexistence of such Application? (Distilled from Ground I)\n2. Whether there is any provision or procedure in a garnishee proceedings that avails the\nAppellants/Judgment Debtors to show cause why the attached monies should not be paid to the\nJudgment Creditors/Respondents in satisfaction of the judgment debt (Distilled from Ground 2)\n3. Whether the provisions of S:49(2) of the Copyright Act Cap C28 Laws of the Federation are not\nsubject to the judicial power of the court while exercising her jurisdiction and judicial power pursuant to\nS:6(6) (a)&(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic Of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) (Distilled from\nGround 3)\n4. Whether in the circumstances of this case the consent of the Attorney General is a sine qua non\nbefore the garnishee proceedings could be commenced and if the answer is in the positive whether in a\nconstitutional democracy that provides for the doctrine of Separation of Powers it is constitutionally\ncompliant to subject the enforcement of the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to a prior\nimprimatur of an Attorney General who is an integral part of the executive arm of government before\nsuch judgment can be enforced. (Distilled from Ground 4)\nMy lords, looking at the issues as formulated by the parties in their respective briefs in the light of the\nfacts and circumstances of this case and the proceedings of 25/6/2012 when the garnishee\norders nisi were made absolute by the court below, I am of the view that the four issues as distilled in\nthe Appellants' brief, which are devoid of the long narratives in the four issues distilled in the 1st - 5th\nRespondents' brief, are the apt issues arising for determination in this appeal.\nHowever, I had earlier in this judgment alluded to the direct effect of the judgment of this court in\nAppeal No. CA/L/925/2011: Nigeria Copyright Commission & Ors V. Musical Society of Nigeria Ltd/ GTE\n& Ors, which is on the appeal against the judgment of the court below, which enforcement by\ngarnishee proceedings by the 1st - 5th Respondents is the subject matter of this appeal.\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:08 PM\nNigerian Copyright Commission and Others v Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria LTD/GTE (CA/L/692/12) [2017] NGCA 1 (8 J\u2026\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngca/2017/1/eng@2017-06-08\n4/7\nIn the judgment delivered in the said appeal, this court had found that the 1st - 5th Respondents' suit\non which the judgment of the court below was based was both incompetent and thus a nullity and also\nlacking in merit and had allowed the appeal, set aside the said judgment of the court below and\nproceeded to strike out and or dismissed the 1st - 5th Respondents' suit.\nThe law is far too settled to be disturbed now that out of nullity nothing worth anything or something\ncan emerge or be predicated thereon. The Latin Maxim goes thus: Nihil non exspectanl aedificare stare:\nOne cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stand. No! it would simply collapse like a pack\nof cards. See Benjamin Leonard Macfoy V. VAC Limited (1962) AC 152.\nIt follows therefore, the judgment of the court being found to be a nullity and or lacking in merit and\nwholly set aside by this court and the 1st - 5th Respondents' suit struck out for being incompetent and\nor dismissed for lacking in merit, there can in law be no valid and lawful enforcement of such a\njudgment. The Garnishee orders absolute made by the court below on 25/6/2012 had thus\nautomatically become a nullity also without much ado and is liable to be set aside exdibito justitae. In\nlaw, both the judgment of the court and all the resultant orders made pursuant to such a null judgment\nare all simply nothing but nullities upon nullities ending up in nullity. They confer neither any benefits\nnor liabilities on the parties. See Zenith Bank Pic. V. Archibong & Ors (2013) LPELR - 20204 (CA) @pp.\n13 - 15. See also Umanah V. Attah (2006) 17 NWLR (Pt. 1009) 503; Awoyegbe &Anor V. Chief Ogbeide\n(1988) NWLR (Pt. 73) 695.\nIn Otu V. ACB International Bank Pic (2008) 3 NWLR (Pt. 1073) 179, the Supreme Court per Mohammad\nJSC, had emphatically pronounced on this issue of the effect of a null judgment inter alia thus:\n\"It is settled law that a judgment that is a nullity has no legal validity and can confer no rights nor\nimpose any obligation on anybody\"\nAnd in Memudu Ajiboye V. Alhaji Oloyede Ishola (2006) 13 NWLR (Pt. 998) 628, the Supreme Court per\nOnnoghen JSC, (as he then was but now CJN) had put it so succinctly inter alia thus:\n\"That being the case, it then follows clearly that the order of non suit contained in the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeal declared a nullity is of no moment that is why the court considered it a waste of time\nand energy to go into a consideration of the propriety of the said order\"\nIn law therefore, a null judgment though it existed as a fact, is devoid of any legal consequences. It is as\nif the said judgment does not exist. That is why when a judgment or order is a nullity, in law it is as if it\nwas never given or made by the Court. See Gbaniyi Osafile & Anor V. Paul Odi & Anor (1990) 2 NWLR\n(Pt. 137) 130. See also Okoye V. Nigerian Construction & Furniture Ltd. (1991) 6 NWLR (Pt. 199) 501 @\np. 503; UBA Plc. & Anor V. Mrs. Ugoenyi & Anor (2011) LPELR - 5065 (CA); .Bello V. INEC (2010) 8 NWLR\n(Pt. 1196) 342.\nIn the circumstances therefore, and in the light of all I have said and held above, I hold that the\ngarnishee orders absolute predicated on the null and set aside judgment of the court below are by\nthemselves also nullities. In law, it need be stressed, here and now, that a judgment or order which is a\nnullity need not even be appealed against. It is null for all purposes with no legal effect whatsoever. In\nFUTECH Yola V. Musa Sani Futuless (2005) 12 NWLR (Pt. 938) 175, this issue was put so poetically by the\ncourt inter alia thus:\n\"If an order is void, the party whom it purports to affect can ignore it and he who has obtained it will\nproceed thereon at his own peril\"\nSee also Marsh V. Marsh (1945) AC 271; Macfoy V. VAC Ltd. (Supra)\nI shall leave all the various recondite issues of law posed by this appeal for another day safe to say that\nthe facts of this appeal presented a bizarre twist whereby a court would in one breadth set aside its\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:08 PM\nNigerian Copyright Commission and Others v Musical Copyright Society of Nigeria LTD/GTE (CA/L/692/12) [2017] NGCA 1 (8 J\u2026\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngca/2017/1/eng@2017-06-08\n5/7\nAbout NigeriaLII\nTerms of Use\norder of stay of execution on the ground that it was made while an appeal has been duly entered in this\ncourt and then in another breath in the same proceedings proceed to, while the appeal had remained\nentered in this court and pending hearing and determination, to allow an application to enforce the\nsame judgment by means of garnishee proceedings, which judgment enforcement it had earlier stayed\nbut discharged at its discretion has having been made after the appeal has been entered.\nSo, is enforcement of judgment by garnishee proceeding, aptly referred to as attachment of debts, still\nnot a means of enforcement of judgment? In law can a garnishee proceedings be proceeded with to\nconclusion after a stay of execution has been ordered by the court simply because it is a distinct\nprocedure for enforcement of judgment from writ of execution under Section 19 - 54 of the Sheriffs and\nCivil Process Act? Would a court which had ordered a stay of execution still proceed with a garnishee\nproceeding and order a garnishee order absolute? To all these posers I answer, albeit briefly, in one\nphrase; I think not! See CBN V. Auto Imports Export Ltd (2013) 2 NWLR (Pt. 1337) 80 for the five\nconditions precedent for a valid garnishee proceedings in law, I say no more!\nMy lords, there can be no better juncture than here and now to end this judgment. I hereby so end it.\nConsequently, the appeal has merit and it hereby allowed. In the result, the garnishee orders absolute\nmade by the court below on 25/6/2012 in Suit No. FHC/L/CS/35/2008: Musical Society of Nigeria\nLtd/GTE & Ors V. Nigeria Copyright Commission & Ors., pursuant to the application for garnishee\norders by the 1st - 5th Respondents in enforcement of the judgment of the court below delivered on\n25/7/2011 in the said suit, are hereby wholly set aside being nullities and of no legal effect whatsoever.\nThe garnishee orders absolute are consequently hereby vacated and discharged and every step or\nactions taken there under are also hereby set aside and thus any monies garnisheed under and by\nvirtue of the said null orders of garnishee order absolute shall forthwith be returned or paid back to the\nAppellants by the 1st - 5th Respondents.\nThere shall be no order as to cost.\n\u00a0\nJOSEPH SHAGBAOR IKYEGH J.C.A: I had a preview of the judgment prepared by my learned brother,\nBiobele Abraham Georgewill, J.C.A., in which I concur.\nJAMILU YAMMAMA TUKUR JCA.

It is the grundnorm i.e. it is the basic law from which all other laws of the society derive their validity.\nSection 1(1) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides: 1(1) This Constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities\nand persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria. (3) If any other law is inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution, this Constitution shall\nprevail, and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency be void. See: Abacha v. Fawehinmi (2000) 6 NWLR (pt.660) 228: P.D.P. v. C.P.C. (2011) 17\nNWLR (Pt. 1277) 485.\"\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - SUPREMACY OF THE CONSTITUTION - Whether the constitution of the country is the supreme law\n\"The time honoured principle of law is that wherever and whenever the Constitution speaks any provision of an Act/Statute, on the same subject matter,\nmust remain silent. See: INEC v. Musa (2003) 3 NWLR (Pt.806) 72; AG Ogun State v. AG Federation (1982) 2 NCLR 166.\"\nTRIBUNAL - CODE OF CONDUCT TRIBUNAL - Criminal jurisdiction of the Code of Conduct Tribunal\n\"The learned appellant's senior counsel's stance is that the tribunal has no power to issue bench warrant because it has no criminal jurisdiction since it can\nnot impose any punishment. I do not agree with the learned appellant's senior counsel on that submission, because Paragraph 1 to 11 of the 5th Schedule to\nthe 1999 Constitution, as amended, gave the tribunal powers to try persons who contravene the offences listed therein, especially offences bordering on\nbribery and corruption by public officers. This Court in the case of Ahmed vs. Ahmed (2013) 15 NWLR (Pt.1377) 274 stated as below: \"If I may repeat, the\nCode of Conduct Tribunal has been established with exclusive jurisdiction to deal with all violations contravening any of the provisions of the Code as per\nParagraph 15(1). This provision has expressly ousted the power of ordinary regular Courts in respect of such violation. The tribunal to the exclusion of other\nCourts is also empowered to impose any punishment as specified in or Subsection (2)(a)(b) of Paragraph 18\" From the above pronouncement by this Court,\nit clearly shows that the tribunal, at least has quasi-criminal jurisdiction or limited jurisdiction as rightly held by the Lower Court. Having said so, I have no\nhesitation in holding that since it has criminal jurisdiction, it goes without saying, that it can as well competently issue bench warrant to arrest any person\nor accused person charged before it, if such person/accused fails to appear before it as is the case of the present appellant in this instant case. To accept\nthe submission of the learned appellant's counsel that it has no power to issue such bench warrant, could mean opening flood gate for such suspects to\nrefuse to appear before the tribunal and such situation will render the powers of Court or tribunal ineffective and it will ultimately stultify the administration\nof criminal justice. It needs to also be stressed here, that the provisions of Paragraph 18(1) empowers the tribunal to make finding of guilt and to also impose\npunishment which to me, buttresses the point, that the tribunal has criminal jurisdiction.\"\nTRIBUNAL - CODE OF CONDUCT TRIBUNAL - Criminal jurisdiction of the Code of Conduct Tribunal\n\"The issue, as contended by learned Senior Counsel for appellant is simply whether the sanctions specified in Section 23(2) Code of Conduct Bureau and\nTribunal Act and Paragraph 18(2) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended not being the traditionally recognized criminal law sanctions\nsuch as fines or imprisonment, they are not basically more of administrative than criminal sanctions, known to law. In the case of United State v. Levet\n(1945) 328 US 303 cited by learned Senior Counsel for appellant. It was held thus: \"Punishment presupposes an offence, not necessarily an act previously\ndeclared criminal, but an act for which retribution is exacted. The fact that harm is inflicted by governmental authority does not make it punishment.\nFiguratively speaking all discomforting action may be deemed punishment because it deprive of what otherwise would be enjoyed. But there may be\nreasons other than punitive for such deprivation. A man may be forbidden to practice medicine because he has been convicted of a felony or because he\nis no longer qualified. The deprivation of any rights, civil or political, previously enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances attending and the causes of\nthe deprivation determination this fact.\" Clearly therefore, there are administrative and criminal sanctions. Is it correct to say that the sanctions the Code of\nConduct Tribunal can impose are purely administrative, if so why are the provisions of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act and Paragraph 18 of\nthe 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended replete with unambiguous terms and expressions indicating that the proceeding before the said\nCode of Conduct Tribunal are criminal in nature? The terms and expressions used in the above legislations include arrest, arraignment, the charge, plea,\nprosecution, conviction, guilty, sentence, prerogative of mercy, etc. See Sections 23, 24 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act; Paragraph 18 of the\n5th Schedule in the 1999 Constitution, as amended; Paragraphs 3, 4 and Forms 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Third (3rd) Schedule to the Code of Conduct Bureau\nand Tribunal Act. Finally, Paragraph 17 of the 3rd Schedule to the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act empowers the Tribunal to apply the provisions of\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/179\nthe Criminal Procedure Act or Code in the conduct of its proceedings in the \"trial of offences generally.\" With the repeal of the Criminal Procedure Act and\nCriminal Procedure Code, Section 493 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, has taken their place. The 3rd Schedule to the Code of Conduct\nBureau and Tribunal Act is actually headed \"Code of Conduct Tribunal Rules of Procedure\" and is sub-divided as follows: (1) Institution of proceedings (2)\nOrder on an accused to appear (3) Commencement of trial (4) Plea of not guilty or no plea; (5) Presentation of case for prosecution (6) Procedure after\npresentation of evidence by the prosecutor; (7) Defence, etc. From the totality of the provisions it is my view that it is clear that the intention of the\nlegislature is to make the proceedings of the Tribunal criminal proceeding to be regulated by criminal procedure. It must be observed that the nature of the\npunishment to be imposed by the Tribunal is not exhaustive at the moment because Paragraph 8(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as\namended and Section 23(1) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act contain a provision to the effect that the National Assembly may prescribe\n\"such other punishment\" other than the current ones to be imposed by the Tribunal. This clearly shows a possibility of the National Assembly imposing\nsanctions of fines and or imprisonment for offences under the Act or Paragraph 18 of the 5th Schedule to the said 1999 Constitution, as amended, if so\ndesired. The Lower Court in considering the issue had come to the conclusion that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a Tribunal with limited criminal\njurisdiction. However, looking closely at the provisions of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended and the Code of Conduct Bureau and\nTribunal Act, earlier referred to in this judgment, it is safer to hold that the said Tribunal has a quasi-criminal jurisdiction designed by the 1999 Constitution,\nas amended. It is a peculiar Tribunal crafted by the Constitution. In the circumstance, I hold the strong view that as a Tribunal with quasi-criminal\njurisdiction with authority to be guided by the Criminal Procedure Act or Code in the conduct of its proceedings, it can legally issue bench warrant for the\npurpose of carrying out its quasi criminal jurisdiction. I should not be understood as saying that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a Court of superior record\nor jurisdiction with relevant inherent powers and sanctions but that as a quasi-criminal Tribunal/Court, it has the necessary powers to put into effect its\nmandate of ensuring accountability, probity, transparency etc of public officers in public office.\"\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL - Effect of the absence of an Attorney General from office\n\"The effect of the absence of an Attorney-General from office (i.e. where his office is vacant), this Court clarified the issue in no uncertain terms. It was\nheld, inter alia \"Chief Olanipekun, SAN seriously attacked the appellant on the ground that at the time he appealed, the office of the Attorney-General was\nvacant and that meant that the Attorney-General was dead legally. It took so much time to cite authorities particularly on the expression dead to buttress\nthe point that it does not mean in the context physical cessation of breath in medical palace. Section 150(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of\nNigeria 1999 creates the office of Attorney-General of the Federation. Let me read it quickly ... It would appear that the Attorney-General is the only\nMinister specifically created in the Constitution. Section 147(1) of the Constitution ominously create the office of Minister of the Government of the\nFederation. In view of the fact that the office is created in the Constitution, and unless or until the office is abrogated, it will continue in perpetuity. And any\nsuit by or against the Attorney-General will in law be absorbed by the office, which never dies unless the Constitution abrogates it. At the time the\nappellant, the Attorney-General, filed the appeal, the office was and is in existence. It is very much alive and not dead as contended by Chief Olanipekun.\"\nSee: AG Federation v. ANPP (2003) 18 NWLR (Pt 851) 182 at p.209. Thus, the absence of an Attorney-General from office either on the basis of non-\nappointment of one or on the basis of infirmity of body or mind of the occupant of that office, that office must remain alive and active. Assignments placed\non the office by the Constitution or other statutes must not stagnate but must be carried out by other competent officers of the office.\"\nAPPEAL - REPLY BRIEF - What should a reply brief be limited to\n\"A reply brief should only address new issues raised in a respondent's brief which were earlier not canvassed or argue or to clarifying some grey areas\nraised in the respondent's brief but certainly NOT to emphasis, add, fine-tune or repeat what had earlier been argued in the appellant's brief.\"\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - DOCTRINE OF COVERING THE FIELD - Effect of the doctrine of covering the field\n\"Where the doctrine of covering the field is in vogue in the Constitution any other legislation on the same field whether by the Federal/State government\nmust bow to the dictate of the Constitution.

(c) ... (2) The powers conferred upon the Attorney-General of the Federal on under\nSubsection (1) of this Section may be exercised by him in person or through officers of his department.\"\nACTION - ACADEMIC/SPECULATIVE/HYPOTHETICAL SUITS - Attitude of Court to academic matters\n\"This Court is always loathe in pursuing academic issues and as a Court does not make orders in vein See: Iweka v.

Govt. of Anambra State (1984) 1 SCNLR 634.\"\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL - Power of the Solicitor General to exercise the functions of the Attorney General\nwhere the office of the latter is vacant\n\"As a complimentary law to the provisions of the Constitution in relation to initiation of proceedings by the Attorney-General. (Section 174 of the\nConstitution) Sections 2 and 4 of the Law Officers' Act, the Solicitor-General of the Federation can competently step into the shoes of the Attorney-\nGeneral of the Federation to exercise the power to initiate criminal proceedings before the Code of Conduct Tribunal since there was no sitting Attorney\nGeneral. The Sections provide as follows: \"2. The offices of the Attorney-General and Solicitor General and State counsel are hereby created 4. The\nSolicitor-General of the Federation in the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation may perform any of the duties and shall have the same\npowers as are imposed by law on the Attorney-General of the Federation.\" The Law Officers' Act details the matter of delegation of powers conferred on\nthe Attorney General of the Federation by statute, on the Solicitor-General of the Federation whenever there is no incumbent Attorney-General in office as\nin the present case. By necessary intendments, both Section 4 of the Law Officers Act and Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau Tribunal Act are\nnot opposed to each other but complementary in that whenever there is no Attorney-General in office, the Solicitor-General is empowered to exercise the\nfunctions or powers conferred by Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act on the Attorney-General of the Federation.\"\nCOURT - JURISDICTION - Effect of a court hearing a matter where it has no jurisdiction\n\"...it is equally trite that where the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a cause or matter, the entire process no matter how well conducted, is an exercise in\nfutility. The proceedings would amount to a nullity ab initio and liable to be set aside.\"\nCOURT - JURISDICTION - Meaning of jurisdiction\n\"The meaning of the word jurisdiction has been accepted - as the authority which a Court or Tribunal has to decide matters presented in a formal way for\nits decision. Where a Court does not have jurisdiction, there is nothing before it to adjudicate. The limits of its authority as in the present case may be\nprescribed, as it has been prescribed by Statute under which the Court or Tribunal was created. Concisely stated, jurisdiction means the authority which a\nCourt or Tribunal has to decide matters contested before it or to take cognizance of matters presented in a formal way for its decision as stated by this\nCourt in NATIONAL BANK v. SHOYOYE (1975) 2 SC. 181. To put it in another way, a Court or Tribunal can only adjudicate on a controversy between litigants\nbefore it when it has jurisdiction to do so. See KALIO v. DANIEL KALIO (1975) 2 SC. 15.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - CHARGE(S) - Whether the person filing a charge must produce evidence of his authority to so do at the time\nof filing the charge or at arraignment\n\"In any event, it is not the usual practice of the Courts to demand letter of authority authorising a counsel such as Mr. Hassan to sign the charge before the\ntribunal. In fact, there is no statutory duty imposed on the person filing a charge to produce any evidence of his authority at the time of filing the charge or\nat arraignment. Comptroller NPS v. Adekanye (No.1) (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt.790) 318 at 328; Bode George v. FRN (2011) 10 NWLR (Pt.1254) at p.66. In Nnakwe v.\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n5/179\nState (2013) 18 NWLR (Pt.1385) 1 at p27, this Court observed: \"The same principle was earlier applied by this Court in the case of Compt. NPS v Adekanye\n(No.1) (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt.790) 318. This was a case where the respondents were prosecuted by a private legal practitioner on behalf of the Federal\nGovernment. Upon objection raised by the respondents' counsel, the Court of Appeal sought for the production of the fiat by counsel to the Federal\nGovernment. On further appeal to this Court, a presumption of authority was held in favour of a counsel who announces appearance for a party,\nnotwithstanding that he possesses a fiat or a letter of instruction. It was further held that the presumption of authority can only be rebutted by hard\nevidence adduced by the other party; this from all indications has not been shown to be the case in the present appeal. Rather, and from the available\nevidence, it is on record that the Attorney-General of the Federation did authorise and ratify the preferment at the said count 4. There is no contrary\nevidence to this fact which can only be debunked by producing such as clearly restated in Adekanye's case (supra).\" My lords, the presumption of regularity\nis sacrosant. Where a legal practitioner informs the Court that he was authorised (as did Mr. Hassan), the Court/tribunal must believe the counsel. It is left\nfor the party challenging him to prove otherwise. See Comptroller of Prisons v. Adekanye (supra), page 330 B-D.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - POWER OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL - Whether the power of the Attorney-General to institute criminal\nproceedings is exclusive\n\"My lords, delegation of the powers of the Attorney General whether of the Federation or State as donated to him by the Constitution, to officers of his\nMinistry or to Agencies such as the Police, the code of conduct Bureau, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission the Customs the Nigerian Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (NDIC), the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and even to private legal practitioners, to initiate criminal proceedings\nagainst any person alleged to have committed an offence, is not strange or a novelty. This Court per Belgore, JSC (as he then was later, CJN) (retired), did\nobserve as follows \"It is clear from the provision of Section 160 of the 1979 Constitution that the Attorney Generals powers or public prosecution is not\nexclusive; the 'any other authority or person' in Subsection (1) can institute and undertake criminal proceedings. The Central Bank of Nigeria and the\nNigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation are also authorities that can Institute criminal proceedings under Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial\nMalpractices in Banks Decree 1994.\" See the case of Comptroller of Prisons v. Adekanye (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt 790) 318 at p.329. Again in the year 2006 the\nsame Belgore, in the case of FRN v. Osahon (2006) 5 NWLR (Pt.973) 361 at p.406, held: \"Police authority can, by virtue of the aforementioned provisions of\nSection 174(1) of the Constitution prosecute any criminal suit either through his legally qualified officers or through any counsel they may engage for the\npurpose (see Comptroller General v. Adekanye). Any other authority or persons can definitely institute criminal prosecution. The power of the Attorney-\nGeneral of the Federation or of the State are not exclusive, any other person or authority can prosecute. However, the Attorney General can take over or\ncontinue the prosecution from any such authority or persons. He can also discontinue by way of nolle prosequi. One year later, i.e in 2007 in FRN v.\nAdewunmi (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt 1042) 399 at pp 418 - 419, this Court dealt specifically with the constitutional provisions, i.e. Section 174 and 211 of the\ncurrent Constitution: \"There is no doubt at all that the power to institute criminal proceedings against any person in the 1999 Constitution lies on the\nAttorney-General of the State of the Federation as the case may be, but such power may be exercised by the Attorney General himself or through any\nofficers in his department. See Sections 174 and 211 of the 1999 Constitution. These sections though very familiar in content do not require that the officer\ncan only exercise the power to initiate criminal proceedings if the Attorney General expressly donated his power to them. The provisions of this section\npresumed that any officer in any department of the Attorney General's office is empowered to initiate criminal proceedings unless it is proved otherwise.\nThis will not be conflict with our decision in AG Kaduna State v. Hassan (1985) 2 NWLR (Pt.8) 483, where the main controversy was that there was no\nincumbent Attorney General who could have donated the power to discontinue criminal prosecution in the case concerned. There is also no doubt in my\nmind that Mrs. Fatunde, an Assistant Chief Legal officer in the Federal Ministry of Justice, D.P.P. office, is an officer in one of the department of the Attorney\nGeneral of the Federation and is highly qualified to initiate criminal proceedings against the respondent. She has therefore validly and properly, in my view\nsigned the amended charge filed on 27th October, 1999.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - POWER OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL - Statutory provision as regards the power of the Attorney General of the\nFederation to institute criminal proceedings\n\"In our Federal Constitution, 1999 (as amended), it is provided as follows: \"The Attorney General of the Federation shall have power. a) to institute and\nundertake criminal proceedings against any person before any Court of law in Nigeria other than Court Martial in respect of any offence created by or\nunder any Act at the National Assembly. b) to take over and continue any such criminal proceedings that may have been instituted by any other authority\nor person; and c) to discontinue at any stage before Judgment is delivered any such criminal proceedings instituted or undertaken by him at any other\nauthority or person. d) the powers conferred upon the Attorney General of the Federation under Subsection (1) at this Section may be exercised by him in\nperson OR THROUGH OFFICERS OF HIS DEPARTMENT.\"\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n6/179\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - RULES OF INTERPRETATION OF CONSTITUTION - Rules governing the interpretation of Constitutional provisions\n\"In view of the importance of the Constitution, any of its provisions must be interpreted in such a manner to enhance its purpose. In cases of ambiguity, real\nor perceived, the provision in question must be construed in such a way as to avoid what is inconvenient or absurd. See Black's Law Dictionary Special\nDeluxe 5th Edn p.234.\"\nLEGISLATION - INTERPRETATION ACT,(Cap.192) LAWS OF THE FEDERATION OF NIGERIA 1990 - At what instance will the courts apply the\nInterpretation Act\n\"The Interpretation Act may be called in aid to determine whether the interpretation given accords with the intention of the lawmakers. The Interpretation\nAct is an Act of the National Assembly, which has been incorporated by reference, into the Constitution and is applicable to the 5th Schedule. Section 28 of\nthe Interpretation Act provides: \"28. Quorum Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act or other enactment the quorum of any tribunal, commission of\nenquiry (including an appeal tribunal established for the purpose of hearing any appeal arising therefrom) shall not be less than two (including the\nChairman): Provided that the chairman and the member shall be present at every sitting of the tribunal, commission of enquiry throughout the duration of\nthe trial or hearing.\" As rightly submitted by learned senior counsel for the respondent, relying on the case of: NDIC v. OKEM ENT. (2004) 10 NWLR (Pt.880)\n107 @ 182, \"when the term \"notwithstanding\" is used in a statute it is meant to exclude an impinging or impeding effect of any other provision of the statute\nor other subordinate legislation so that the said section may fulfil itself.\" I therefore agree with him that Paragraph 12 of the 3rd Schedule to the CCBT Act,\nwhich provides for rules of procedure for the tribunal, cannot override the provisions of Section 318 (4) of the Constitution, which, by reference,\nincorporated the provisions of Section 28 of the Interpretation Act.\"\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - POWER(S) OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL - Whether the powers of the Attorney General can be exercised by an officer in\nhis department\n\"In interpreting the provisions of Section 174 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended or similar provision under the 1979 Constitution - Section 160 thereof,\nthis Court has held in a number of cases that the Attorney General's power of public prosecution is not exclusive as any other authority or person can\ninstitute and undertake criminal prosecution - see FRN v. Adewunmi supra, at 418-419 where this Court stated inter alia thus: \"These sections though very\nfamiliar in content do not require that the officer can only exercise the power to initiate criminal proceedings if the Attorney-General expressly donated his\npower to them. The provisions of this Section presumed that any officer in any department of the Attorney Generals office is empowered to initiate\ncriminal proceeding unless it is proved otherwise\" See also FRN v. Osahon (2006) 5 NWLR (Pt.973) 361. It is very clear that the power of initiating criminal\nproceedings by any officer of the department of the Attorney General of the Federation is not dependent on the office of the said Attorney General of the\nFederation having an incumbent. Another provision that needs looking into in trying to resolve the issue under consideration is Sections 2 and 4 of the Law\nOfficers Act, Cap L.8, LFN 2004 which enact as follows: \"2. The Office of the Attorney General, Solicitor General and State Counsel are hereby created. 4.\nThe Solicitor General of the Federation in the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation may perform any of the duties and shall have the same\npowers as are imposed by law on the Attorney General of the Federation.\"\nWORDS AND PHRASES - \"QUORUM\" - Definition of the word \"quorum\"\n<div>\"It is apposite at this point to refer to the definition of \"quorum\" as contained in the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (infra) at page 1203. It is as\nfollows: \"Quorum: the smallest number of people who must be at a meeting before it can begin or decisions can be made.\"</div>\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - GOLDEN RULE OF INTERPRETATION - What the golden rule of interpretation entails\n\"The golden rule of interpretation is that where the words used in the Constitution or in a statute are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their\nnatural and ordinary meaning unless to do so would lead to absurdity or inconsistency with the rest of the statute.

Duke (2007) 16 NWLR (pt 1059) 22; AG, Bendel v. AG, Federation (1982) 3 NCLR 1. Above all,\nthe rationale of all binding authorities is that a narrow interpretation that would do violence to its provisions and fail to achieve the goal set by the\nConstitution must be avoided. Thus, where alternative constructions are equally open, the construction that is consistent with the smooth working of the\nsystem, which the Constitution read as a whole has set out to regulate is to be preferred, Dapianlong v. Dariye (2007) 8 NWLR (pt 1036) 239. The principle\nthat underlies this construction technique is that the Legislature would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result, IMB v. Tinubu\n(2001) 16 NWLR (Pt.740) 690; Tukur v. Government of Gongola State [1989] 4 NWLR (pt 117) 517, 579; Aqua Ltd v. O. S. S. C.

This approach is consistent with the \"living tree\" doctrine of\nconstitutional interpretation enunciated in Edward v. Canada [1932] AC 124 which postulates that the Constitution \"must be capable of growth to meet the\nfuture,\" N. K. Chakrabarti, Principles of Legislative and Legislative Drafting, (Third Edition) (Kolkata: R. Cambray and Co.

I, therefore, endorse the position that the construction\nof any document (and this includes the construction of the precious and organic document known as the 1999 Constitution) is a holistic endeavour, United\nSav.

In Section 285(3) of the said 1999 Constitution, it is provided thus: \"The\ncomposition of the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunal and the Governorship Election Tribunal respectively shall be as set out in the\nsix Schedule to this Constitution.\" However, Paragraph 1(1) of the said sixth Schedule enacts thus:- ''A National and State Houses of Assembly Election\nTribunal shall consist of a Chairman and two other members\" -just like the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as\namended in relation to the Code of Conduct Tribunal. In order to determine the quorum of the said National and State Houses of Assembly Election\nTribunal, Section 285(4) of the said 1999 Constitution as amended by the First Alteration provides that:'' The quorum of an election Tribunal established\nunder this Section shall be the Chairman and one other member.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - CRIMINAL TRIAL/PROCEEDINGS - Whether irregularities, defect or error in a summons or warrant will affect a\ncriminal proceeding\n\"On issue 4, it is the submission of learned Senior Counsel for appellant that the Lower Court was in error when it held that notwithstanding the lack of\nproper service on the appellant of the Criminal Summons to appear before the Tribunal on 18th September, 2015, such a vice was a mere irregularity which\nwas cured by the appearance of appellant at the proceedings despite the conditional appearance of appellant on protest. The complete answer to the\nabove issue as argued lies in the provision of Section 136(a) of the Administration of Criminal Justice 2015 to the effect that trials may be held\nnotwithstanding- (a) any irregularity, defect or error in the summons or warrant or in the issuing service or execution of the Summons or Warrant. By\noperation of Section 4(2)(b) of the Interpretation Act, references to the Criminal Procedure Act and/or Criminal Procedure Code in the Third (3rd) Schedule\nto the Code of Conduct and Bureau Tribunal Act particularly Rule 17 thereof are understood or construed to mean references to Section 136 of the said\nAdministration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015. The said Section 136(a) of the Act provides as follows: \"Where a defendant is before a Court, whether\nvoluntarily or on summons or after being arrested with or without warrant, or while in custody for the same or any other offence, the trial may be held\nnotwithstanding -(a) any irregularity, defect or error in the summons or warrant or in the issuing, service, or execution of the summons or warrant.\"\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/179\nWORDS AND PHRASES - \"NOTWITHSTANDING\" - Meaning of the word \"notwithstanding\" when used in a statute\n<div>\"In NDIC v.

Undoubtedly, the\nconstitutional provisions (enshrined in the Fifth Schedule), dealing with the code of conduct for public officers, were primarily designed to enthrone probity\nin the public lives of public officers (that is, officers listed in Part II of the Fifth Schedule) and, a fortiori, to promote transparency and accountability in\ngovernance. The Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB, for short) and the CCT are the bodies responsible for effectuating the said code of conduct provisions. In\nparticular, the latter [CCT] is the adjudicative arm in the entire architecture of the accountability provisions of the Third and Fifth Schedules of the\nConstitution. Its powers are outlined Paragraph 18 of the Fifth Schedule.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - RULES OF INTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - Guiding principles in interpretation of statutes\n\"In interpreting provisions of the Constitution or indeed any statute, the settled principle is that where the words used are devoid of ambiguity, same must\nbe given natural meaning. In other words, where the words used are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning. See:\nDangana v. Usman (2013) 6 NWLR (Pt.1349) 50 at page 93 B-D: Amadi v. INEC (2013) 4 NWLR (Pt.1345) 595 at pages 633 D-F and 634-635 H-C.\"\nTRIBUNAL - CODE OF CONDUCT TRIBUNAL - Position of the law as regards the composition and quorum of the Code of Conduct Tribunal\n\"The issue under consideration is simply whether the said Tribunal as constituted was constitutional or had the vires or jurisdiction or competence to sit\nand conduct any proceedings including the proceedings in question having regard to the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the\nConstitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the 1999 Constitution as amended). The relevant provisions of\nthe 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Acts of the National Assembly relied upon by Counsel for the contending parties are as follows: (1) Paragraph 15(1)\nof the 5th schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amended: \"There shall be established a Tribunal to be known as Code of Conduct Tribunal which shall\nconsist of a Chairman and two other persons.\" Section 20(1) and (2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act; Cap. C15 LFN, 2004 provided thus: \"(1)\nThere is hereby established a Tribunal to be known as the Code of Conduct Tribunal (in this Act referred to as \"the Tribunal\"). (2) The Tribunal shall consist\nof a Chairman and two other members.\" Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended provides thus: \"The Interpretation Act shall apply for the\npurpose of interpreting the provisions of this Constitution.\" On the other hand Section 28 of the Interpretation Act, provides as follows: \"Notwithstanding\nanything contained in any Act or any other enactment, the quorum of any Tribunal, commission of inquiry (including any appeal Tribunal established for the\npurpose of hearing any appeal arising therefrom) shall not be less than two (including the Chairman): Provided that the Chairman and the member shall be\npresent at every sitting of the Tribunal, commission of inquiry throughout the duration of the trial or hearing.\" The issue is, whether by the provisions of the\n1999 Constitution as amended supra, and the Acts of the National Assembly, also reproduced above, the composition of the Code of Conduct Tribunal on\n18th September, 2015 of the Chairman and one member is valid or not? It is the submission of learned Senior Counsel for appellant that the provisions of\nParagraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, (as amended) and Section 20 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act constitute\nboth the composition and quorum of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, which is, that at all times the said Tribunal must consist of a Chairman and two other\nmembers otherwise it is incompetent to sit and transact any business while the respondent contends that the Tribunal is properly constituted for the\npurpose of any proceedings if it consists of Chairman and members thereof. By submitting that the above relevant provisions of the 1999 Constitution as\namended and Sections of the Acts constitute both the composition and quorum of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, learned Senior Counsel for appellant\nadmits that there is a difference between composition and quorum but that in the case of the Tribunal in question, the terms/words mean the same things.\nTo resolve the issue, we shall have to start by understanding some relevant words used in drafting the provisions; these are \"consist of\" At page 208 of New\nWebster's Dictionary of English Language, International Edition, the word \"consist\" is defined inter alia, thus: \"To be made up or composed, to reside or lie\nessentially.\" On the other hand, the word is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition at page 308 as follows: \"To stand together, to be composed of or\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/179\nmade up of.\" From the above definitions, it is very clear, and I hold the view that Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amended\nand Section 20(1) and (2) of Cap C15 LFN 2004 provide for the establishment and composition of the Code of Conduct Tribunal as consisting of a\nChairman and two other members. This construction is clearly the literal meaning of the words used by the draftsman in the relevant sections concerned.\nHowever, does the composition also mean the quorum needed for the Tribunal of a Chairman and two other members to competently conduct any\nproceedings? This leads to the meaning of \"quorum What does it mean? Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Ed Page 1255 defines the word thus: \"A majority of the\nentire body, e.g. a quorum of a State Supreme Court. The number of members who must be present in a deliberative body before business may be\ntransacted. In both houses of congress a quorum consists of a majority of those chosen and sworn. Such a number of the members of a body as is\ncompetent to transact business in the absence of the other members.\" It should be noted that the words \"consist of\" are used in the 1999 Constitution, as\namended in the establishment and composition sections of the Courts of record such as the Court of Appeal in Section 237(2); Federal High Court Section\n249(2). See also Sections 255 and 270 of the said Constitution. Section 230 of the 1999 Constitution, (as amended) established the Supreme Court of\nNigeria and detailed its composition but Section 234 of the said 1999 Constitution provides for the quorum or Constitution of the Court for the purpose of\nexercising its jurisdiction, inter alia, thus: \"For the purpose of exercising any jurisdiction conferred upon it by this Constitution or any law, the Supreme Court\nshall be duly constituted if it consists of not less than five Justices of the Supreme Court ...: See also Section 247(1) in relation to the Court of Appeal. I\nagree with the submission of learned Senior Counsel for the respondent and the Lower Court that the above provisions relate to the quorum of the relevant\nCourts for the purpose of exercising the jurisdiction conferred on them by the Constitution or any law and that such provision is clearly absent in\nParagraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended. The said Paragraph and Section 20(1) and 2 of Cap. C15 of LFN 2004 equally did\nnot contain any expression relating to the composition of the Tribunal in the exercise of its jurisdiction. To determine the quorum of the Code of Conduct\nTribunal as established, one has to look at Section 28 of the Interpretation Act which, by operation of Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended,\nshall apply for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of this Constitution\" It is important to note that a resort to the provisions of the Interpretation Act\nis not for the purpose of filling in a lacuna but of interpretation of the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, (supra) and\nSection 201(1) and (2) of Cap C15 of LFN 2004 which established the Code of Conduct Tribunal as consisting of the Chairman and two other members. In\nother words, what do these provisions mean for the purpose of the tribunal exercising its jurisdiction? The answer is as provided by Section 28 of the\ninterpretation Act thus, inter alia: \"Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act at any other enactment, the quorum of any Tribunal, commission of\ninquiry (including any appeal Tribunal established for the purpose of hearing any appeal arising therefrom) shall not be less than two (including the\nChairman)...\" From the above provision, it is clear that any sitting of the Code of Conduct Tribunal presided by the Chairman and one member, as was the\ncase herein, is valid.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - POWER OF THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL - Power of the Attorney General to delegate his power to institute criminal\nproceedings\n\"The issue of whether any other person apart from the Attorney General of the Federation is empowered to initiate a criminal proceeding has been\ncommented upon by both the trial Tribunal and the Court below. The trial Tribunal made the following finding: \"It is the believe (sic 'belief') of this Tribunal\nthat the powers to initiate proceedings are further enhanced by the provisions of Section 2 and Section 4 of the Law Officers' Act, Cap L8, Laws of the\nFederation of Nigeria. In the absence of Attorney General, the Solicitor General of (sic: 'or') any other officer in the chambers of the Attorney General can\nexercise such powers or duties of the Attorney General relating to institution of criminal proceedings. See also Section 24(3) of the Code of Conduct\nBureau and Tribunal Act Cap C15, 2004 which said prosecutions for all offences referred to in this Act shall be instituted in the name of the Federal Republic\nof Nigeria by the Attorney General or such officers in the Federal Ministry of Justice as the Attorney General may authorise.\" In agreeing with the above\nfinding, the Court below, remarked, inter alia: \"The office of the Attorney General of the Federation is a Constitutional or Statutory office created by Section\n150 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). Unless this office is abolished through the instrumentality of amendment of\nthe relevant provisions of the Constitution, the office like a continum, remains in existence as an artificial or juristic person. Although, the office of the\nAttorney General of the Federation does not die, and indeed has not died, the duties and functions of the Attorney General of the Federation must be\ncarried out or performed by a biological person or natural person, as only a human being can legally and logically occupy the said exalted office. That the\noffice of the Attorney General does not die, unless abrogated by a Constitutional amendment, see: Attorney General of the Federation v. All Nigeria Peoples\nParty & 2 Ors (2003) 18 NWLR (Pt 851) 182 at 249. pet Tobi, JSC.. . I agree that in the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Solicitor-\nGeneral of the Federation may perform his duties and shall have the same powers as are 'imposed by the law on the Attorney-General of the Federation.'\nSee: Section 4 of the Law Officers' Act, 2004 ... The provisions of Section 174(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as\namended) are broad enough to justify Mr. M. S. Hassan, a Deputy Director in the office at the Attorney-General of the Federation to institute the\nproceedings against the appellant in the Tribunal.\" By Court below's affirmation as above of the findings by the Tribunal, the issue of subrogating the\nAttorney-General of the Federation by an officer in his office has now become a concurrent finding of fact which requires special circumstances to warrant\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n10/179\nthis Court to tamper with such a finding. No such special circumstances have been placed before me to make me interfere. I am therefore, loathe to\ninterfere See: Onwugbufor v. Okoye (1996) 1 NWLR (Pt.424) 252; Olatunde v. Abidogun (2001) 18 NWLR (Pt.746) 712: Amayo v. State (2001) 15 NWLR (Pt.745)\n251; Obasohan v Omorodion (2001) 13 NWLR (Pt.729) 206. In any event, my noble lords, it appears ridiculous to pursue the argument that where there is no\nperson occupying the office of the Attorney- General of the Federation, activities in the office such as prosecution of offences in the law Courts would\ngrind to a halt. That office, as rightly stated by the Court below, is a creature of the Constitution or a Statute. It is the same Constitution/Statute that\ndelegated the functions or activities of the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to some other persons such as the Solicitor-General or other\nofficers in the Ministry. The point raised by the learned SAN for the appellant that in order to comply with Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and\nTribunal Act, 2004, the Attorney-General of the Federation is the one required to specifically sign the charge or be available to give consent to the law\nofficer that will sign the charge even if that law officer is the Solicitor-General The Court below adequately and frontally answered this poser in the\nfollowing words: \"I do not agree with the contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that consent to sign or institute prosecution must be\nphysically delegated to the Solicitor-General of the Federation or any other law officer of the Federation. This is because Section 24(2) of the Code of\nConduct Bureau and Tribunal Act cannot be read in isolation of the clear provisions of Section 4 of the Law Officers' Act. The right to perform the duties\nand exercise the powers of the Attorney-General of the Federation by the Solicitor-General, in the absence of the former, has statutory backing and to\nrequire physical consent is a requirement that is merely a surplussage. The Solicitor-General of the Federation while performing the duties and exercising\nthe powers of the Attorney-General of the Federation, in the absence of the latter, can also do so through any law officer in the Federal Ministry of Justice.\nThe law is that there is a presumption that 'any officer in any department of the Attorney-General's office is empowered to initiate criminal proceeding\nunless it is proved otherwise.' See: Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Senator Olawole Julius Adewunmi (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt 1042) 399 at 418 per Kalgo, JSC. The\npresumption to initiate the prosecution in the Tribunal in favour of Mr. M. S. Hassan has not been rebutted by the appellant in this case.\"\nCOURT - COMPETENCE OF COURT - When is a court deemed to be competent\n<div>\"Since it is the competence of the Tribunal that is being challenged in this appeal, the law is that a Court or Tribunal is only competent when:- \"1. It is\nproperly constituted with respect to the number and qualification of its members; 2. The subject matter is within its jurisdiction; 3. The action is initiated by\nthe due Process of law; and 4.

The failure to satisfy any one of\nthese conditions is fatal to the exercise of jurisdiction and adjudication.\"</div>\nCOURT - COMPETENCE OF COURT - When is a court deemed to be competent\n\"It is well settled, almost beyond the need to cite authorities, that the competence of a Court to adjudicate in a cause or matter before it depends on the\nfollowing conditions: a. It must be properly constituted as regards numbers and qualifications of the members of the bench, and no member is disqualified\nfor one reason or the other; b. The subject matter of the case must be within its jurisdiction, and there must be no feature in the case which prevents the\nCourt from exercising its jurisdiction; and c.

The Appellant was a two-\nterm Governor of Kwara State, between May, 2003 and May, 2011. While in the said office the appellant filed, as required by law, four asset declaration forms and\nsubmitted same to the Code of Conduct Bureau. These forms were duly investigated by the Bureau and other relevant agencies of government as a result of which it\nwas allegedly found that the appellant allegedly corruptly acquired many properties while in office as Governor of Kwara State but failed to declare some of them in the\nsaid forms earlier filled and submitted to the relevant authorities. It was also allegedly discovered that the appellant made an anticipatory declaration of assets upon\nhis assumption of office as Governor of Kwara State which he acquired later. It was also alleged that the appellant sent money abroad for the purchase of properties in\nLondon and that he maintained an account outside Nigeria while serving as the said Kwara State Governor. It was the discovery of these alleged violations of the Code\nof Conduct for Public Officers that the Code of Conduct Bureau initiated a criminal proceeding against the appellant before the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Holden at\nAbuja. Upon serving of the summons on him, the appellant filed a motion dated 17th September, 2015 before the Code of Conduct Tribunal challenging the competence\nof charge No.CCT/ABJ/01/2015 and a suit each before the Federal High Court Holden at Abuja and Lagos in which he also challenged the validity of the criminal\nproceedings initiated against him at the Code of Conduct Tribunal.\u00a0In the course of the proceedings in the tribunal on the 18th day of September. 2015 appellant\ncontended that since there was no sitting Attorney-General of the Federation before of at the time charge No CCT/ABJ/01/2015 was filed before the tribunal the said\ncharge was incompetent and that the appellant would not appear before the said tribunal etc.\u00a0The tribunal overruled the objection of the appellant and issued a bench\nwarrant against appellant and adjourned the case to 19th September 2015 to enable appellant appear and take his plea but the appellant did not so appear, resulting in\nthe tribunal renewing its order or bench warrant and adjourned the matter to 22nd September 2015. On 22nd September, 2015 the appellant voluntarily appeared\nbefore the tribunal in person as a result of which the charges preferred against him were read to him and he pleaded not guilty thereto as a result of which the warrant\nof arrest/bench warrant issued against him was revoked, and the appellant granted bail on self recognizance and the matter adjourned to the 21st, 22nd and 23rd of\nOctober, 2015 for hearing. However, on the 2nd day of October, 2015, the appellant filed an appeal against the ruling of the tribunal of 18th September, 2015 before the\nCourt of Appeal. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal which resulted in a further appeal before the Supreme Court.\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/179\nISSUES:\nFor the determination of this appeal, the appellant formulated the following issues for determination:\n''1. Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division was right in the interpretation of the Constitution when it held that the Code of Conduct\nTribunal was properly constituted in law when it sat on 18/09/2015 with just the Chairman and one (1) other member in contravention of the provisions of paragraph\n15(1) of the 5th schedule of the 1999 constitution as to exercise the powers and jurisdiction vested by the 1999 Constitution and if the answer is in the negative,\nwhether the charge and the entire proceedings inclusive of the Ruling in issue is not null and avoid and of no consequence?\n2. Whether the majority decision was right when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a Court of Limited Criminal jurisdiction competent and empowered to\nissue a Bench Warrant against the appellant in the event of his absence from the proceedings of the Tribunal?\u00a0\n3. Having regard to the clear wording of section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C15 2004 whether the 13 count charge preferred against\nthe Appellant by someone other than the Attorney-General of the Federation is competent?\u00a0\n4. Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal was correct in law when it held that notwithstanding the lack of proper service an the Appellant of the Criminal\nSummons to appear before the Code of Conduct Tribunal on the 18th of September 2015 such a vice was a mere irregularity cured by the appearance of the appellant\nat the proceedings regardless of the existence of Appellant's conditional appearance on protest?\n5. Whether the majority decision of the court below was right when it justified the refusal of the Code of Conduct Tribunal to obey the Federal High Court to appear\nbefore it and show cause why it should not order a stay of further proceedings on the ground that the order in issue was not one specifically asking the lower Tribunal\nto stay its proceedings?\u00a0\n6. Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal was correct when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal was a criminal court empowered to apply the\nAdministration of Criminal Justice Act?\"\u00a0\nDECISION/HELD:\nOn the whole, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. The judgment of the Court of Appeal delivered on the 30th day of October, 2015 dismissing the appeal of the\nappellant against the ruling of Code of Conduct Tribunal of 18th September, 2015 was affirmed.\nWALTER SAMUEL NKANU ONNOGHEN, J.S.C. (Delivering the Leading Judgment): This is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Holden at Abuja in\nappeal No. CA/A/551/2015 delivered on the 30th day of October, 2015 in which the Court\u00a0dismissed the appeal of appellant against the ruling of the Code of Conduct\nTribunal in charge No.\u00a0CCT/ABJ/01/2015 delivered on the 18th day of September, 2015 in which the Tribunal held that the criminal charge preferred against appellant was\ncompetent despite the absence of a sitting Attorney\u00a0General of the Federation and issued a bench warrant against appellant for his failure to appear before the\nTribunal and answer/plead to the charges preferred against him.\nThe facts of the case, as can be gathered from the record include the following:\nAppellant was a two-term Governor of Kwara State, between May, 2003 and May, 2011. While in the said office appellant filed, as required by law, four asset declaration\nforms and submitted same to the Code of Conduct Bureau.\nThese forms were duly investigated by the Bureau and other relevant agencies of government as a result of which it was allegedly found that\n1\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/179\nappellant allegedly corruptly acquired many properties while in office as Governor of Kwara State but failed to declare some of them in the said forms earlier filled and\nsubmitted to the relevant authorities. It was also allegedly discovered that appellant made an anticipatory declaration of assets upon his assumption of office as\nGovernor of Kwara State which he acquired later. It was also alleged that appellant sent money abroad for the purchase of properties in London and that he maintained\nan account outside Nigeria while serving as the said Kwara State Governor. It was the discovery of these alleged violations of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers\nthat the Code of Conduct Bureau initiated a criminal proceeding against appellant before the Code of Conduct Tribunal, Holden at Abuja.\nUpon serving of the summons on him, appellant filed a motion dated 17th September, 2015 before the Code of Conduct Tribunal challenging the competence of charge\nNo.CCT/ABJ/01/2015 and a suit each before the Federal High Court Holden at Abuja and Lagos in which he also challenged the validity of the criminal proceedings\ninitiated against him at the Code of Conduct\n2\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n14/179\nTribunal.\nIn the course of the proceedings in the Tribunal on the 18th day of September,\u00a02015 appellant contended that since there was no sitting Attorney\u00a0General of the\nFederation before or\u00a0at the time charge No CCT/ABJ/01/2015 was filed before the Tribunal the said charge was incompetent and that appellant would not appear before\nthe said Tribunal etc.\nThe tribunal overruled the objection of appellant and issued a bench warrant against appellant and adjourned the case to 19th September, 2015 to enable appellant\nappear and take his plea but appellant did not so appear, resulting in the Tribunal renewing its order or bench warrant and adjourned the matter to 22nd September\n,2015.\nOn 22nd September, 2015 appellant appeared before the Tribunal in person as a result of which the charges preferred against him were read to him and he pleaded not\nguilty thereto as a result of which the warrant of arrest/bench warrant issued against him was revoked, and appellant granted bail on self recognizance and the matter\nadjourned to the 21st, 22nd and 23rd of October, 2015 for hearing. It is important to note that appellant voluntarily appeared before the\n3\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/179\nTribunal on the 22nd day of September, 20l5. His appearance was not on the execution of the warrant of arrest issued by the Tribunal.\nHowever, on the 2nd day of October, 2015, appellant filed an appeal against the ruling of the Tribunal of 18th September, 2015 before the Court of Appeal in which the\nfollowing issues were raised for the determination of the appeal.\n1. Whether the Code of Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted when it sat on 18th September, 2015 with only two members.\n2. Whether the Code of Conduct Tribunal was competent to issue bench warrant when it was not a Court of criminal jurisdiction.\n3. Whether the charge preferred against appellant before the Code of Conduct Tribunal when there was no sitting Attorney\u00a0General of the Federation was competent.\n4. Whether the service on appellant of the summons for the proceedings of the 18th of September, 2015 was proper in law, and,\n5. Whether the Code of Conduct Tribunal has the vires to ignore an Order of the Federal High Court barring it from sitting or staying its further proceedings in the\nmatter.\nAs stated earlier in this judgment, the Court of Appeal\n4\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/179\ndismissed the appeal which resulted in the present further appeal before this Court, the issues for the determination of which have been formulated by leading Senior\nCounsel for appellant, J.B. DAUDU, SAN in the appellant's brief filed on 11/11.2015 as follows:-\n''1. Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division was right in the interpretation of the Constitution when it held that the Code of Conduct\nTribunal was properly constituted in law when it sat on 18/09/2015 with just the Chairman and one (1) other member in contravention of the provisions of Paragraph\n15(1) of the 5th Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as to exercise the powers and jurisdiction vested by the 1999 Constitution and if the answer is in the negative,\nwhether the charge and the entire proceedings inclusive of the Ruling in issue is not null and void and of no consequence? (ISSUE NO 1) (Grounds 1 and 2).\n2. Whether the majority decision was right when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a Court of Limited Criminal jurisdiction competent and empowered to\nissue a Bench Warrant against the appellant in the event of his absence from the proceedings of the\n5\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/179\nTribunal? (ISSUE No 2)(Ground 3).\n3. Having regard to\u00a0the clear\u00a0wording of Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C15, 2004 whether the 13 count charge preferred\nagainst the Appellant by someone other than the Attorney\u00a0General of the Federation is competent?

Whether the majority decision of the Court below was right when it justified the refusal of the Code of Conduct Tribunal to obey the Federal High Court to appear\nbefore it and show cause why it should not order a stay of further proceedings on the ground that the order in issue was not one specifically asking the lower Tribunal\nto stay its proceedings?

(ISSUE No 6) (Ground 7).\nOn the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondent ROTIMI JACOBS, SAN identified the following five issues as relevant for the determination of the appeal in\nthe respondent's brief filed on the 18th day of November, 2015. These are:-\n\"1. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right in its unanimous decision when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal was\u00a0properly\u00a0constituted when it heard and\ndetermined the issues that\u00a0culminated in the Tribunal ruling of 18th September, 2015 with the Chairman and one member (See Grounds 1 and 2 of the Notice of Appeal\nat\u00a0pages 1268- 1278)\n2. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal, though a Court of limited criminal jurisdiction, was competent to issue a\nbench warrant against the Appellant in the event of his failure to appear\u00a0before it (see Ground 3 of the Notice of Appeal).\n3. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right in its\n7\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/179\nmajority decision when it held that the charge preferred against the Appellant before the Code of Conduct Tribunal and signed by M. S. Hassan, a Deputy Director in\nthe Federal Ministry of Justice was competent notwithstanding that there was no sitting Attorney\u00a0General of the Federation at the time it was initiated (see Ground 4\nof the Notice of Appeal).\n4. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that the issue of the alleged irregularity in the service of summons on the Appellant to appear before the\nCode of Conduct Tribunal on 18th September, 2015, was not fatal to the proceedings before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (See Grounds 5 and 7 of the Notice of\nAppeal).\n5. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that since the Federal High Court did not make any order on 17th September, 2015 restraining the Code of\nConduct Tribunal from sitting, the issue of disobedience of that order or the superiority of the Federal High Court to the Tribunal would not arise (see ground 6 of the\nnotice of appeal).\"\nIn arguing issue 1, learned leading Senior Counsel for appellant submitted by way of summary that the decision of the Lower\n8\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/179\nCourt was erroneous in the interpretation of the Constitution by holding that the Code of Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted in law when it sat, on\u00a018/9/15 with\njust the Chairman and one other member in contravention of the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as to exercise of powers\nand jurisdiction vested by the 1999 Constitution and in consequence of the charge and entire proceedings inclusive of the ruling resulting in the instant further appeal\nis null and void and of no consequence.\nTo arrive at the above conclusion, learned Senior Counsel referred to Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and stated that the\nwords used therein to the effect that the Code of Conduct Tribunal \"shall consist of a Chairman and two other person\" are clear and precise and must be given their\nnatural meaning - relying on Amasike v.\u00a0Registrar General Corporate Affairs Commission (2006) 3 NWLR (Pt.968) 462 and Ngige v.\u00a0Obi (2006) 14 NWLR (Pt.999) 1; that\nthe literal and ordinary meaning of the provision in question is that for the Code of Conduct Tribunal to be legally functional, there must be\n9\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n21/179\nat least three persons inclusive of its Chairman that where, for whatever reason the membership of the Tribunal falls below three, the deficiency in membership\nadversely affects the jurisdiction; that the above position is supported by Section 20(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act Cap C23, LFN 2004; that\nthe provisions as to the composition of the Tribunal in the Constitution and Cap C23, (supra) admits of no lacuna to be filed by a resort to the provisions of the\nInterpretation Act, as erroneously held by the Court of Appeal that Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule is both the composition and quorum of the Tribunal and that\nrecourse to the Interpretation Act was therefore unnecessary.\nIt is the further submission of learned Senior Counsel that the word \"shall\", as used in the enactments, connotes command admitting of no discretion or permissiveness\nwhile the word \"other\" has been interpreted in Onwudiwe v.\u00a0FRN (2006) 10 NWLR (Pt.988) 382 to mean \"additional\"; that Sections 27 and 28 of the Interpretation Act\ncannot curtail or sideline the Constitutional prescription in Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution neither\n10\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/179\ndid the Section downsize the Constitutional quorum of the Tribunal from 3 to 2; that since the relevant enactments have made exhaustive provisions for the\ncomposition and quorum of the Tribunal, the provisions of the Interpretation Act become irrelevant and consequently inapplicable.\nIt is also the further submission of learned Senior Counsel for appellant that to hold that a 2-man panel of the Tribunal can sit in adjudication contrary to the express\nprovision of the Constitution raises a serious issue of breach of the principles of fair hearing as enshrined in Section 36 of the 1999 Constitution, (as amended) and\nurged the Court to resolve the issue in favour of appellant.\nOn his part, learned Senior Counsel for respondent referred to the relevant provisions of the Constitution and Act and the decision of the Lower Court on the issue\nunder consideration and submitted that the Lower Court was right in coming to the conclusion that the Tribunal was properly constituted on the 18th day of\nSeptember, 2015 when it adjudicated on the matter; that it is not the intendment of the legislature that the three members who are to make up the Tribunal must sit\n11\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/179\ntogether at all times because Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule is the establishment paragraph of the Tribunal because there is a difference between the\nexpression \"consist of\" and \"quorum of\"; that the legislature used the expression \"consist of\"\u00a0not \"quorum of\".\nLearned Senior Counsel then went on to reproduce various definitions of \"consist of and \"quorum of\" to demonstrate their differences; that Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th\nSchedule to 1999 Constitution is the establishment paragraph of the Code of Conduct Tribunal to be made up of a Chairman and two other members as its\ncomposition; that the said paragraph makes no provision for the quorum of the Tribunal for the purpose of transaction of legally valid business. Learned Senior Counsel\nthen referred to certain Sections of the Constitution establishing the Courts of record and Tribunals - including election Tribunals and submitted that composition of\nthe bodies is different from their quorum; that to determine the quorum of the Tribunal resort must be had to the provision of Section 28 of the Interpretation Act\nwhich provides that the Chairman and a member shall be sufficient to form a quorum of\n12\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/179\nany Tribunal including the Code of Conduct Tribunal; that the Interpretation Act is applicable to be the interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution as expressly\nprovided in Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution and held by this Court in A-G Federation v. A-G Anambra State (No.2) (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt.754) 542 at 855; that\nthe decision in Okoro v. Nigerian Army Council (2003) 3 NWLR (Pt.647) 77 and State v. Olatunji (2003) 14 NWLR (Pt.839) 138 are not relevant to the facts of this case\nand consequently inapplicable as they relate to the non-qualification of the members of the Court Martial and not the quorum of the Court Martial.\nFinally, learned Counsel urged the Court to resolve the issue against appellant.\nThe reply brief of appellant filed on 25/11/15 re-emphasized the points already made in the appellant's brief. I therefore see no need to reproduce them herein as to do\nso would no useful purpose.\nIt is not disputed that the proceedings of the Code of Conduct Tribunal including the ruling thereof conducted on the 18th day of September, 2015 was conducted by\nthe Chairman and a member thereof; that is two members of the Tribunal\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/179\n13\nincluding the Chairman conducted the proceedings and delivered the ruling in issue. The issue under consideration is simply whether the said Tribunal as constituted\nwas constitutional or had the vires or jurisdiction or competence to sit and conduct any proceedings including the proceedings in question having regard to the\nprovisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the 1999\nConstitution as amended).\nThe relevant provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Acts of the National Assembly relied upon by Counsel for the contending parties are as follows:-\n(1) Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amended:\n\"There shall be established a Tribunal to be known as Code of Conduct Tribunal which shall consist of a Chairman and two other persons.\"\nSection 20(1) and (2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act; Cap. C15 LFN, 2004 provided thus:\n''(1) There is hereby established a Tribunal to be known as the Code of Conduct Tribunal (in this Act referred to as \"the Tribunal\").\n(2) The Tribunal shall\n14\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/179\nconsist of a Chairman and two other members.\"\nSection 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended provides thus:\n''The Interpretation Act shall apply for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of this Constitution.\"\nOn the other hand Section 28 of the Interpretation Act, provides as follows:-\n\"Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act or any other enactment, the quorum of any Tribunal, commission of inquiry (including any appeal Tribunal established\nfor the purpose of hearing any appeal arising therefrom) shall not be less than two (including the Chairman):\nProvided that the Chairman and the member shall be present at every sitting of the Tribunal, commission of inquiry throughout the duration of the trial or hearing.\"\nThe issue is, whether by the provisions of the 1999 Constitution as amended supra, and the Acts of the National Assembly, also reproduced above, the composition of\nthe Code of Conduct Tribunal on 18th September, 2015 of the Chairman and one member is valid or not? It is the submission of learned Senior Counsel for appellant\nthat the provisions of\u00a0Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to\u00a0 the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/179\n15\nSection 20 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act constitute both the composition and quorum of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, which is, that at all times\nthe said Tribunal must consist of a Chairman and two other members otherwise it is incompetent to sit and transact any business while the respondent contends that\nthe Tribunal is properly constituted for the purpose of any proceedings if it consists of Chairman and members thereof.\nBy submitting\u00a0that the above relevant provisions of the 1999 Constitution as amended and Sections of the Acts constitute both the composition and quorum of the\nCode of Conduct Tribunal, learned Senior Counsel for appellant admits that there is a difference between composition and quorum but that in the case of the Tribunal\nin question, the terms/words mean the same things.\nTo resolve the issue, we shall have to start by understanding some relevant words used in drafting the provisions; these are \"consist of\"\nAt page 208 of New Webster's Dictionary of English Language, International Edition, the word \"consist\" is defined inter alia, thus:-\n\"To be made up or composed .... to reside or lie essentially.\"\n16\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/179\nOn the other hand, the word is defined in Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition at page 308 as follows:-\n\"To stand together, to be composed of or made up of.\"\nFrom the above definitions, it is very clear, and I hold the view that Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amended and Section 20(1) and\n(2) of Cap C15 LFN 2004 provide for the establishment and composition of the Code of Conduct Tribunal as consisting of a Chairman and two other members. This\nconstruction is clearly the literal meaning of the words used by the draftsman in the relevant sections concerned.\nHowever, does the composition also mean the quorum needed for the Tribunal of a Chairman and two other members to competently conduct any proceedings? This\nleads to the meaning of \"quorum What does it mean?\nBlack's Law Dictionary, 6th Ed Page 1255 defines the word thus:\n\"A majority of the entire body, e.g. a quorum of a State Supreme Court. The number of members who must be present in a deliberative body before business may be\ntransacted. In both houses of congress a quorum consists of a majority of those chosen and sworn. Such a number of the members\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n29/179\n17\nof a body as is competent to transact business in the absence of the other members.\"\nIt should be noted that the words \"consist of\" are used in the 1999 Constitution, as amended in the establishment and composition sections of the Courts of record\nsuch as the Court of Appeal in Section 237(2); Federal High Court Section 249(2). See also Sections 255 and 270 of the said Constitution.\nSection 230 of the 1999 Constitution, (as amended) established the Supreme Court of Nigeria and detailed its composition but Section 234 of the said 1999\nConstitution provides for the quorum or Constitution of the Court for the purpose of exercising its jurisdiction, inter alia, thus:\n''For the purpose of exercising any jurisdiction conferred upon it by this Constitution or any law, the Supreme Court shall be duly constituted if it consists of not less\nthan five Justices of the Supreme Court ... . : See also Section 247(1) in relation to the Court of Appeal.\nI agree with the submission of learned Senior Counsel for the respondent and the Lower Court that the above provisions relate to the quorum of the relevant Courts for\nthe purpose of exercising the\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n30/179\n18\njurisdiction conferred on them by the Constitution or any law and that such provision is clearly absent in Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999\nConstitution, as amended. The said Paragraph and Section 20(1) and 2 of Cap. C15 of LFN 2004 equally did not contain any expression relating to the composition of\nthe Tribunal in the exercise of its jurisdiction.\nTo determine the quorum of the Code of Conduct Tribunal as established, one has to look at Section 28 of the Interpretation Act which, by operation of Section\n318(4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended, shall apply for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of this Constitution\"\nIt is important to note that a resort to the provisions of the Interpretation Act is not for the purpose of filling in a lacuna but of interpretation of the provisions of\nParagraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, (supra) and Section 20(1) and (2) of Cap\u00a0C15 of LFN 2004 which established the Code of Conduct\nTribunal as consisting of the Chairman and two other members. In other words, what do these provisions mean for the purpose of the tribunal exercising its\njurisdiction?\nThe answer is as provided by Section 28 of the Interpretation Act\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/179\n19\nthus, inter alia:\n\"Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act at any other enactment, the quorum of any Tribunal, commission of inquiry (including any appeal Tribunal established\nfor the purpose of hearing any appeal arising therefrom) shall not be less than two (including the Chairman)...\"\nFrom the above provision, it is clear that any sitting of the Code of Conduct Tribunal presided by the Chairman and one member, as was the case herein, is valid.\nThe above position is very much similar to the provisions of Section 285(1) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended by Section 29 of the First Alteration Act which\nestablishes the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunals. In Section 285(3) of the said 1999 Constitution, it is provided thus:-\n\"The composition of the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunal and the Governorship Election Tribunal respectively shall be as set out in the six\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/179\nSchedule to this Constitution.\"\nHowever, Paragraph 1(1) of the said sixth Schedule enacts thus:-\n''A National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunal shall consist of a Chairman and two other members\" - just like the\n20\nprovisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended in relation to the Code of Conduct Tribunal.\nIn order to determine the quorum of the said National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunal, Section 285(4) of the said 1999 Constitution as amended by\nthe First Alteration provides that:\n''The quorum of an election Tribunal established under this Section shall be the Chairman and one other member.\"\nIt is therefore very clear from the above that the interpretation given by learned Senior Counsel for appellant in respect of the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th\nSchedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended as constituting both the composition and quorum of the Code of Conduct Tribunal cannot be correct, having regard to\nthe provisions of the Constitution and laws examined supra.\nBefore leaving this issue, I need to comment on the case of Okoro v.\u00a0Nigerian Army Council and State v.\u00a0Olatunji (supra) cited and relied upon by learned Senior Counsel\nfor appellant. I agree with learned counsel for respondent that the facts of both cases are totally different from those of the instant case and that\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n33/179\n21\nthose cases relate to the qualification of the members of the Court-Martial which has nothing to do with the quorum of the said Court-Martial. The question was\nwhether a member of the Armed Forces of a lower rank than that required by Section 133(3) of the Armed Forces Actis qualified to sit and deliberate on matters in\nthe Court- Martial.\nIn the circumstance, I resolve issue 1 against appellant.\nIn respect of issue 2, it is the submission of learned Senior Counsel for appellant that the Lower Court was in error when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a\nCourt of limited criminal jurisdiction competent and empowered to issue a Bench Warrant against appellant in the event of his absence from the proceedings of the\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n34/179\nTribunal; that contrary to the holding of the Lower Court on the issue, Paragraph 18(1), (2), (3) and (4) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amended,\ndemonstrates that the jurisdiction of the Code of Conduct Tribunal is not criminal because the Tribunal was not designed to exercise criminal jurisdiction as none of\nthe punishments available under penal legislations is made available to the Tribunal as can be seen in\n22\nParagraph 15(2) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended;\u00a0that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a disciplinary body for public officers who fall\nbelow the acceptable level of probity, ethics etc; that the Code of Conduct Tribunal not being a Court with criminal jurisdiction, it cannot take refuge under the\nAdministration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 or issue summons, warrants of arrest and other penal processes and that the physical presence of appellant at the Code of\nConduct Tribunal was consequently not necessary. Learned Senior Counsel urged the Court to resolve the issue favour of appellant.\nOn his part, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent submitted that the contention by appellant that the Tribunal has no criminal jurisdiction because it cannot\nimpose any of the punishments in the penal legislation is misconceived as borne out by a careful consideration of the entire provisions of the 5th Schedule to the 1999\nConstitution, as amended; that by the provisions of Paragraph 1 - 10 of the 5th Schedule, the Tribunal has the power to try certain contraventions that border on\ncorruption by public officers such as bribe, receipt of unauthorized gift\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n35/179\n23\nand abuse of office; that the Tribunal has power to impose punishment after making a finding of guilt - which are part of the exercise of criminal jurisdiction; that the\npunishment of forfeiture of asset under Paragraph 18(2) (c) of the 5th Schedule is also prescribed under Section 30 of the Economic and Financial Crimes\nCommissions (Establishment, etc) Act Cap El LFN 2004; Section 20 of the said EFCC Act and Section 11 and 17 of the Advance Fee Fraud Act, Cap Act LFN 2010; that\nthe Tribunal is not the same as any of the professional disciplinary bodies like the Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Committee and Medical and Dental Practitioners\nDisciplinary Committee which are not creatures of the Constitution; that this Court should be persuaded by the decision of the full Court of the Court of Appeal in A-G\nFederation v. Abubakar (2007) 8 NWLR (Pt.1035) 117 to the effect that the Code of Conduct Tribunal has criminal jurisdiction and urged the Court to resolve the issue\nagainst appellant.\nIn the reply brief, learned Senior Counsel for appellant submitted that the Code of Conduct does not provide an offence named \"corruption\" or \"abuse\" which are\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n36/179\n24\nexpressly offences the ICPC Act and EFCC Act or other legislations which vests jurisdiction in the Federal High Court; that there is a difference between a disciplinary\npenalty and a punishment for an offence, relying on United State v.\u00a0Levett (1945) 328 US 303 and that the Court should not rely on the A-G Federation v.\u00a0Abubakar\ndecision of the Court of Appeal as it cannot import meaning into the 1999 Constitution, as amended not intended by the legislature.\nThe issue, as contended by learned Senior Counsel for appellant is simply whether the sanctions specified in Section 23(2) Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal\nAct and Paragraph 18(2) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended not being the traditionally recognized criminal law sanctions such as fines or\nimprisonment, they are not basically more of administrative than criminal sanctions, known to law.\nIn the case of United State v. Levet (1945) 328 U.S. 303 cited by learned Senior Counsel for appellant. It was held thus:\n\"Punishment presupposes an offence, not necessarily an act previously declared criminal, but an act for which retribution is exacted. The fact that harm is\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n37/179\n25\ninflicted by governmental authority does not make it punishment. Figuratively speaking all discomforting action may be deemed punishment because it deprive of what\notherwise would be enjoyed. But there may be reasons other than punitive for such deprivation. A man may be forbidden to practice medicine because he has been\nconvicted of a felony...or because he is no longer qualified. ... the deprivation of any rights, civil or political, previously enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances\nattending and the causes of the deprivation determination this fact.\"\nClearly therefore, there are administrative and criminal sanctions.\nIs it correct to say that the sanctions the Code of Conduct Tribunal can impose are purely administrative, if so why are the provisions of the Code of Conduct Bureau\nand Tribunal Act and Paragraph 18 of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended replete with unambiguous terms and expressions indicating that the\nproceeding before the said Code of Conduct Tribunal are criminal in nature? The terms and expressions used in the above legislations include arrest, arraignment, the\ncharge, plea, prosecution,\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n38/179\n26\nconviction, guilty, sentence, prerogative of mercy, etc. See Sections 23, 24 of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act; Paragraph 18 of the 5th Schedule in\nthe 1999 Constitution, as amended; Paragraphs 3, 4 and Forms 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Third (3rd) Schedule to the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act. Finally,\nParagraph 17 of the 3rd Schedule to the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act empowers the Tribunal to apply the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act or\nCode in the conduct of its proceedings in the \"trial of offences generally.\" With the repeal of the Criminal Procedure Act and Criminal Procedure Code, Section 493 of\nthe Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, has taken their place. The 3rd Schedule to the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act is actually headed \"Code of\nConduct Tribunal Rules of Procedure\" and is sub-divided as follows:\n(1) Institution of proceedings\n(2) Order on an accused to appear.\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n39/179\n(3) Commencement of trial\n(4) Plea of not guilty or no plea;\n(5) Presentation of case for prosecution\n(6) Procedure after presentation of evidence by the prosecutor;\n(7) Defence, \u00a0etc.\n27\nFrom the totality of the provisions it is my view that it is clear that the intention of the legislature is to make the proceedings of the Tribunal criminal proceeding to be\nregulated by criminal procedure.\nIt must be observed that the nature of the punishment to be imposed by the Tribunal is not exhaustive at the moment because Paragraph 18(1) of the 5th Schedule\nto the 1999 Constitution, as amended and Section 23(1) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act contain a provision to the effect that the National\nAssembly may prescribe \"such other punishment\" other than the current ones to be imposed by the Tribunal. This clearly shows a possibility of the National Assembly\nimposing sanctions of fines and or imprisonment for offences under the Act or Paragraph 18 of the 5th Schedule to the said 1999 Constitution, as amended, if so\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n40/179\ndesired.\nThe Lower Court in considering the issue had come to the conclusion that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a Tribunal with limited criminal jurisdiction. However, looking\nclosely at the provisions of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution, as amended and the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, earlier referred\n28\nto in this judgment, it is safer to hold that the said Tribunal has a quasi-criminal jurisdiction designed by the 1999 Constitution, as amended. It is a peculiar Tribunal\ncrafted by the Constitution. In the circumstance, I hold the strong view that as a Tribunal with quasi-criminal jurisdiction with authority to be guided by the Criminal\nProcedure Act or Code in the conduct of its proceedings, it can legally issue bench warrant for the purpose of carrying out its quasi criminal jurisdiction. I should not be\nunderstood as saying that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a Court of superior record or jurisdiction with relevant inherent powers and sanctions but that as a quasi-\ncriminal Tribunal/Court, it has the necessary powers to put into effect its mandate of ensuring accountability, probity, transparency etc of public officers in public\noffice.\nI therefore resolve issue 2 against appellant\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n41/179\nOn issue 3, it is the submission of learned Senior Counsel for appellant that having regard to the clear wording of Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and\nTribunal Act, the 13 count charge preferred against appellant by someone other than the Attorney-General\n29\nof the Federation is incompetent and liable to be set aside; that where a person other than the Attorney-General of the Federation files a charge as in the instant case,\nit was mandatory for the person to prove due authorization by the Attorney-General or the Solicitor-General of the Federation, which the respondent failed to do; that\nthe provisions of Section 2 and 4 of the Law Officers Act, Cap L18 LFN 2004 which generally authorizes the Solicitor General of the Federal Ministry of Justice to\nauthorize Law Officers to act on behalf of the Ministry in the absence of sitting Attorney-General of the Federation does not apply to the facts of this case which\nspecifically requires the Attorney-General of the Federation to act personally or directly before an act can be valid, relying on Matari v.\u00a0Dangaladima (1993) 3 NWLR\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n42/179\n(Pt.281) 266; that is not in dispute that at the time of filing the charge, there was no sitting Attorney-General of the Federation; in the alternative that there is nothing to\nshow that the Solicitor-General either exercised the powers of the Attorney-General under the Code of Conduct Tribunal Act or authorized any other person to\nexercise same\n30\nand urged the Court to resolve the issue in favour of appellant.\nIt is the contention of learned Senior Counsel for respondent that the power to initiate criminal prosecution in Nigeria is conferred on the Attorney-General of the\nFederation by the provisions of Section 174 and 211 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended and overrides every other law including Section 24(2) of the Code of\nConduct Bureau and Tribunal Act; that Section 174(1) and (2) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended also recognizes the fact that other authorities or persons, apart\nfrom the Attorney-General may initiate and undertake criminal proceedings against any person, relying on Comptroller of Prisons v. Adekanye (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt.790)\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n43/179\n318 at 318 at 329; FRN v. Osahon (2006) 5 NWLR (Pt.973) 361 at 406; FRN v. Adewunmi (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt.1042) 399 at 418 - 419.\nIn the alternative, learned Senior Counsel submitted that M. S. Hassan Esq, a Law Officer, can competently initiate a criminal proceedings by virtue of Section 2 and 4 of\nthe Law Officers Act; that there was no issue raised either at the Tribunal or the Lower Court on appeal that M. S. Hassan, Esq does not have\n31\nauthority of\u00a0the Solicitor-General, as such the need for the proof of such authorization did not arise; that in any event, it is only the Solicitor-General or the Attorney-\nGeneral of the Federation that can challenge the authority of Mr. Hassan to file the charge in question, not any other person relying on FRN v. Adewunmi (supra) at 416 -\n417. Finally counsel urged the Court to resolve the issue against the appellant.\nSection 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act which forms the basis of the issue under consideration provides as follows:-\n\"(2) Prosecutions for all offences referred to in this Act shall be instituted in the name of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the Attorney-General of the Federation or\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n44/179\nsuch officers in the Federal Ministry of Justice as the Attorney-General of the Federation may\u00a0authorize so to do.\"\nIt s not disputed that at the time M. S Hassan Esq, a Law Officer the Federal Ministry of Justice filed the charge against appellant, there was no sitting Attorney-General\nof the Federation. It is the contention of learned Senior Counsel for appellant that with the absence of a sitting Attorney-General of the\n32\nFederation, M. S. Hassan Esq, could not have been so authoized by an absent Attorney-General of the Federation to initiate the criminal proceedings against appellant\nas required by the said Section 24(2) supra. The contention of learned Senior Counsel for appellant is also that the provision of Section 24(2) supra is mandatory and\nthat non-compliance vitiates the charge and proceedings arising therefrom. The question is whether learned Senior Counsel is right.\nI had earlier, the consideration of issue 2 supra, come to the conclusion that the Code of Conduct Tribunal has quasi-criminal jurisdiction over matters before it. The\nabove being the case, it is necessary to look at the Constitutional powers of the Attorney-General of the Federation in initiating criminal prosecutions as enshrined in\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n45/179\nSection 174 (1) and (2) of the 1999 Constitution, as amended which provides thus:\n'(l) The Attorney-General of the Federation shall have power -\n(a) to institute and undertake criminal proceedings (sic) (prosecution) against any person before any Court of law in Nigeria, other than a Court-Martial, in respect of\nany offence created by or under any Act of\n33\nthe National Assembly;\n(b) .............\n(c) ..............\n(2) The powers conferred upon the Attorney-General of the Federal on under Subsection (1) of this Section may be exercised by him in person or through officers of\nhis department.\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n46/179\nIt is not in doubt that the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act which created the offences peculiar to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is an Act of the National\nAssembly in fact and by operation of law.\nAlso not in dispute in the fact that M. S. Hassan Esq, a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Justice is a Law Officer in the department/chambers of the Attorney-\nGeneral of the Federation.\nIn interpreting the provisions of Section 174 of the 1999 Constitution, as amended or similar provision under the 1979 Constitution - Section 160 thereof, this Court\nhas held in a number of cases that the Attorney-General's power of public prosecution is not exclusive as any other authority or person can institute and undertake\ncriminal prosecution - see FRN v.\u00a0Adewunmi supra, at 418-419 where this Court stated inter alia thus:\n\"These sections though very familiar in content do not require that the\n34\nofficer can only exercise the power to initiate criminal proceedings if the Attorney-General expressly donated his power to them. The provisions of this Section\npresumed that any officer in any department of the Attorney-Generals office is empowered to initiate criminal proceeding unless it is proved otherwise...\" See also FRN\nv.\u00a0Osahon (2006) 5 NWLR (Pt.973) 361.\nIt is very clear that the power of initiating criminal proceedings by any officer of the department of the Attorney-General of the Federation is not dependent on the\noffice of the said Attorney-General of the Federation having an incumbent.\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n47/179\nAnother provision that needs looking into in trying to resolve the issue under consideration is Sections 2 and 4 of the Law Officers Act, Cap L.8, LFN 2004 which\nenact as follows:-\n\"2. The Office\u00a0of the Attorney-General, Solicitor General and State Counsel are hereby created.\n4. The Solicitor General of the Federation in the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation may perform any of the duties and shall have the same powers as\nare imposed by law on the Attorney-General of the Federation.\"\nIt is not in dispute that at the\n35\ntime the Law Officer, M. S. Hassan Esq initiated the proceedings by filing the charge against appellant, there was and still is, a sitting Solicitor General in the Federal\nMinistry of Justice. I had earlier also found that M. S. Hassan Esq is a Law Officer in the department of the Attorney-General of the Federation.\nThirdly, there is no issue before the Tribunal and the Lower Court concerning the authority of the Solicitor General authorizing Mr. Hassan to file the charge since by the\nprovisions of Section 4 of the Law Officers\u00a0Act supra, the Solicitor General, in the absence of a sitting Attorney-General, as in the instant case, \"may perform any of\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n48/179\nthe duties and shall have the same powers as are imposed by law on the Attorney-General of the Federation\" such as that imposed by Section 24(2) of the Code of\nConduct Bureau and Tribunal Act.\nIn the circumstance and having regard to the state of the law applicable to the facts relevant to the issue considered supra, I find no merit in issue 3 which is hereby\nresolved against appellant.\nOn issue 4, it is the submission of learned Senior Counsel for appellant that the Lower Court was in error when it\n36\nheld that notwithstanding the lack of proper service on the appellant of the Criminal Summons to appear before the Tribunal on 18th September, 2015, such a vice was\na mere irregularity which was cured by the appearance of appellant at the proceedings despite the conditional appearance of appellant on protest.\nThe complete answer to the above issue as argued lies in the provision of Section 136(a) of the Administration of Criminal Justice 2015 to the effect that trials may\nbe held notwithstanding-\n(a) any irregularity, defect or error in the summons or warrant or in the issuing service or execution of the Summons or Warrant.\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n49/179\nBy operation of Section 4(2) (b) of the Interpretation Act, references to the Criminal Procedure Act and/or Criminal Procedure Code in the Third (3rd) Schedule to the\nCode of Conduct and Bureau Tribunal Act particularly Rule 17 thereof are understood or construed to mean references to Section 136 of the said Administration of\nCriminal Justice Act, 2015. The said Section 136(a) of the Act provides as follows:-\n'' Where a defendant is before a Court, whether voluntarily or on summons or after being arrested with or without\n37\nwarrant, or while in custody for the same or any other offence, the trial may be held notwithstanding -\n(a) any irregularity, defect or error in the summons or warrant or in the issuing, service, or execution of the summons or warrant.\"\nIn the circumstance issue 4 is also resolved against appellant.\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n50/179\nIt is the submission of learned Senior Counsel for appellant on issue 5 that the decision of the Lower Court was wrong when it justified the refusal of the Code of\nConduct Tribunal to obey the order of the Federal High Court to appear before it and show cause why it should not order a stay of further proceedings on the ground\nthat the order in issue was not one specifically asking the Tribunal to stay its proceedings.\nI have carefully gone through the record particularly the order of the Federal High Court in suit No FHC/ABJ/CS/775/2015 issued on the 17th day of September, 2015 and\nreproduced at pages 946 - 949 of Vol. 2 of the record and the judgment of the Lower Court on the issue particularly at pages 1243 - 1244 of the record and I have no\nhesitation in agreeing with the decision of the Lower Court on the matter. \u00a0The Lower Court found/held as\n38\nfollows, inter alia:-\n''It is apparent on the face of the record of appeal that the Tribunal was misled into believing or thinking that the Federal High Court made an Order \"barring\" it from\nsitting. There was no such order. The order of the Federal High Court reproduced above, merely directed the main respondents \"to appear before this Court... And show\ncause why the interim orders of injunction being sought by the plaintiff/appellant should not be made...The respondent to the Appellant ex-parte application could\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n51/179\n\"appear\" before the Federal High Court either by themselves or by their legal practitioners to react to the appellants motion on notice for interim injunction. The order\nof the Federal High Court did not ask the Tribunal to stay proceedings or further proceedings in the case, the subject matter of this appeal. Since there was no order by\nthe Federal High Court directing the Tribunal to stay proceedings, the argument of the contending parties on whether or not the Tribunal is a superior Court having\ncoordinate jurisdiction with the Federal High Court are merely of academic relevance.\"\nAs stated earlier, the above decision cannot be faulted\n39\nhaving regard to the facts of the case and arguments of Counsel on the issue concerned. The only positive order made by that Court was for the respondents to\nappear before the Federal High Court and show cause why the interim orders of injunction being sought by the appellant should not be made. The respondents to the\napplication in which the order was made could appear either personally or by legal practitioners. They were not ordered to appear in person. In any event the suit in\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n52/179\nwhich the order was made is not the matter giving rise to this appeal.\nI hold the view that if appellant felt aggrieved with the conduct of the respondents in respect of the order in issue, appropriate processes could be initiated in the suit\nin which the order was made to seek appropriate redress. In any event, there was no order of the Federal High Court staying the proceedings of the Tribunal which was\ndisobeyed by the Tribunal. I hold the view that the instant issue is an attempt at intimidating the Code of Conduct Tribunal which is very unfortunate.\nIn the circumstance I find this issue, like the others already considered, of no merit and accordingly resolved against appellant.\n40\nHaving resolved issues 1 - 5 supra against appellant, I see no need to consider issue 6 because such a consideration will serve no useful purpose. In fact issue 6 has\nalready been resolved in substance against appellant during my consideration of issue 2 supra.\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n53/179\nIn conclusion, I find no merit in the appeal which is accordingly dismissed.\nThe judgment of the Lower Court delivered on the 30th day of October, 2015 dismissing the appeal of appellant against the ruling of Code of Conduct Tribunal of 18th\nSeptember, 2015 is hereby affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nMAHMUD MOHAMMED, J.S.C.: I have been privileged to have read in advance the Judgment of my learned brother Onnoghen, JSC., dismissing the Appellant's appeal. I\nagree entirely with his reasoning and conclusion. I wish only to comment on the two main issues of competence of the trial Code of Conduct Tribunal to try the\nAppellant for contravention of the Provisions of the Code of conduct for Public Officers of the Federation and whether or not the trial of the Appellant was properly\ninitiated by a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Justice on the authorization of the\n41\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n54/179\nSolicitor-General of the Federation in the absence of a sitting Attorney-General of the Federation.\nMy learned brother Onnoghen JSC, has stated the facts giving rise to the appeal compendiously and with admirable clarity. I adopt them. I shall confine myself in the\ndetermination of this appeal to the two issues I mentioned in my introduction above which were identified as issues one and three in the Appellant's brief of argument\nas follows:-\n\"1. Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal Abuja Division was right in interpretation of the Constitution when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal\nwas properly constituted in Law when it sat on 18/9/2015 with just the Chairman and one (l) other member in contravention of the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the\n5th Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as to exercise the powers and jurisdiction vested by the 1999 Constitution and if the answer is in the negative, whether the\ncharge and the entire proceedings inclusive of the Ruling in issues is not null and void and of no consequence?\"\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n3. Having regard to the wording of the Section 24(2) of the Code\n42\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n55/179\nof Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act CAP C.15 2004, whether the 13 Count-Charge preferred against the Appellant by someone other than the Attorney-General of\nthe Federation is competent?\"\nStarting with issue number one quoted above, it was argued for the Appellant by his learned Senior Counsel who after quoting the Provision ofParagraph 15(1) of the\n5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amendedwhich states:-\n\"15(1) There shall be established a Tribunal to be known as the Code of Conduct Tribunal which shall consist of a Chairman and two other Persons.\"\nstressed that the provisions are quite plain and unambiguous thereby requiring no further interpretation. According to him, where the words of the Constitution or any\nStatute are clear, precise and unambiguous, they must be given their natural and indeed literal meaning, relying on the cases of AMASIKE v. REGISTRAR GENERAL ,\nCAC \u00a0(2006) 3 NWLR (Pt.968) 462 and NGIGE v. OBI (2006) 14 NWLR (Pt.999) 1, in support of the argument. In the understanding of the learned Senior Counsel, the\nliteral and ordinary interpretation of the Provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution,\n43\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n56/179\nnot only the establishment, and composition of the Code of Conduct Tribunal were made therein but that the quorum of the Tribunal as well. That is to say for the\nCode of Conduct Tribunal to be legally functional, there must be at least three persons inclusive of its Chairman. Learned Senior Counsel therefore concluded that\nsince the Code of Conduct Tribunal sat with only the Chairman and one member on 18/9/2015 in exercise of its jurisdiction and powers in contravention of Paragraph\n15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution in the proceedings and delivery of the Ruling of the Tribunal now on appeal, the Ruling of 18/9/2015 and the entire\nproceedings are null and void and of no consequence whatsoever, and therefore urged this Court to allow the appeal on this issue and reject the call by the\nRespondent's Senior Counsel for the application of Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended and Section 28 of the Interpretation Act to the\ninterpretation of the clear provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the same 1999 Constitution as amended.\nHowever, the learned Senior Counsel to the Respondent is of the view that the interpretation\n44\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n57/179\nplaced on the Provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amended by the learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant, was\nmisconceived although agreeing with him that the provisions are very clear and unambiguous. Relying on a number of cases including OBIOHA v. DAFE (1994) 2 NWLR\n(Pt.325) 157 at 180 - 181 and ODUA INVESTMENT CO. LTD v. TALABI (1997) 10 NWLR (Pt.523) 1 at 58, learned Senior Counsel pointed out that since the construction of the\nprovisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amended does not lead to any manifest absurdity, the words should be given their\nnatural and ordinary meaning of merely providing for the establishment and composition of the Tribunal only, leaving the question of quorum for the sitting of the\nTribunal to the provisions of Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended and Section 28 of the Interpretation Act CAP 123 Laws of the Federation.\nLearned Senior Counsel drew clear distinction between the words \"consist of\" used in the provision of the 1999 Constitution as amended establishing the Code of\nConduct Tribunal and the words \"Quorum of\" providing for\n45\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n58/179\nquorum of the Courts established under the same Constitution in Section 234 for the Supreme Court and Section 237 for the Court of Appeal and came to the\nconclusion that no provision for quorum was made in Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution as amended establishing the Code of Conduct\nTribunal.\nThat having regard to the absence of the Provision for quorum in the Constitutional provision establishing the Code of Conduct Tribunal, the trial Tribunal and the Court\nbelow were right in resorting to the provisions of Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution and Section 28 of the Interpretation Act to resolve the question in\nsustaining the validity of the proceedings of the Tribunal of 18/9/2015 and subsequently its Ruling now on appeal.\nThe Appellant's issue number one now under consideration is challenging the unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal that the Court was right in its decision that\nthe Code of Conduct Tribunal was right in holding that it was properly constituted on l8/9/2015 when it sat and conducted its proceedings and ultimate Ruling with only\nthe Chairman and one other member. This in effect is a challenge to the\n46\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n59/179\njurisdiction of the Tribunal as vested under the Constitution. The meaning of the word jurisdiction has been accepted - as the authority which a Court or Tribunal has\nto decide matters presented in a formal way for its decision. Where a Court does not have jurisdiction, there is nothing before it to adjudicate. The limits of its authority\nas in the present case may be prescribed, as it has been prescribed by Statute under which the Court or Tribunal was created. Concisely stated, jurisdiction means the\nauthority which a Court or Tribunal has to decide matters contested before it or to take cognizance of matters presented in a formal way for its decision as stated by\nthis Court in NATIONAL BANK v. SHOYOYE (1975) 2 SC.181. To put it in another way, a Court or Tribunal can only adjudicate on a controversy between litigants before it\nwhen it has jurisdiction to do so See KALIO v. DANIEL KALIO (1975) 2 SC. 15.\nSince it is the competence of the Tribunal that is being challenged in this appeal, the law is that a Court or Tribunal is only competent when:-\n\"1. It is properly constituted with respect to the number and qualification of its members;\n47\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n60/179\n2. The\u00a0subject matter is within its jurisdiction;\n3. The action is initiated by the due Process of law; and\n4. The condition Precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction has been satisfied.\"\nas laid down by this Court in its leading decision on this subject in the case of MADUKOLU & ORS v. NKEMDELIM & ORS (1962) All NLR 587 per Bairamain, JSC. The failure\nto satisfy any one of these conditions is fatal to the exercise of jurisdiction and adjudication.\nIn this appeal, the Chairman of the Tribunal whose jurisdiction was challenged by the Appellant was of the view that the Tribunal was properly constituted and therefore\ncompetent to assume jurisdiction, sitting with the Chairman and only one of its two other members. On appeal against this stand taken by the Chairman of the Tribunal\nto the Court of Appeal, that Court in its split decision of two to one given on 30/10/2015, agreed with the Chairman of the Tribunal to give rise to the present appeal.\nThe simple question for determination in this issue is whether the Code of Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted with its Chairman and only one of its two\nmembers for the determination of its\n48\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n61/179\npowers and jurisdiction in the proceedings against the Appellant on 18/9/2015. The provisions of the 1999 Constitution as amended calling for interpretation are in\nParagraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution which provides:-\n\"15. Code of Conduct Tribunal\n(1) There shall be established a Tribunal to be known as the Code of Conduct Tribunal which shall consist of a Chairman and two other persons.\"\nThe above provisions as agreed by the learned Senior Counsel to the Parties in this appeal, are quite clear, plain and unambiguous. The words therefore must be given\ntheir ordinary meaning unless such interpretation would lead to manifest absurdity or unless the context requires some special or particular meaning to be given to the\nwords. See BRONIK MOTORS v. WEMA BANK (1983) 1 SCNLR 296. It is not\u00a0in doubt at all that the Code of Conduct Tribunal is a creation of the Constitution in Paragraph\n15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the Constitution quoted above, which only provided for its establishment and composition with a Chairman and two other persons. No\nProvision was made in that paragraph for quorum of the Tribunal which is very vital for\n49\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n62/179\nits smooth operation in the discharge of its powers and jurisdiction. The construction being placed on the provisions of the paragraph as having also made provision for\nmandatory quorum of three with the Chairman of the Tribunal, will do violence to the provision of that paragraph by reading in the paragraph words which are clearly\nnot there at all.\nLooking into the provision of Section 285(1) of the 1999 Constitution as amended, the establishment of the National and State Assembly Election Tribunal was\nprovided therein while Sub-Section (3) of that Section provides for the composition of the Election Tribunals as follows:-\n\"(3) The composition of the National and State Assembly Election Tribunal and the Governorship Election Tribunal respectively shall be as set out in the Sixth Schedule\nto this Constitution.\"\nParagraph 1(1) of the Sixth Schedule proceeded to provide the composition of the Tribunal to consist of a Chairman and two other members as was provided for the\nCode of Conduct Tribunal in Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the same 1999 Constitution as amended. While the same Constitution failed to make provision for\nquorum for the\n50\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n63/179\nCode of Conduct Tribunal, the same Constitution proceeded in Sub-Section 4 of Section 285 of the 1999 Constitution as amended to provide quorum for Election\nTribunal as follows:-\n\"(4) The quorum of an Election Tribunal established under this Section shall be the Chairman and one other member.\"\nIt is for this reason that resort has to be made to the provisions of Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended and Section 28 of the Interpretation Act\nCAP 123 Laws of the Federation to provide for quorum to ensure the smooth exercise of the functions of the Code of Conduct Tribunal in the discharge of its powers\nand jurisdiction for which it was created under the Constitution. Section 28 of the Interpretation Act provides:-\n\"(28) Quorum Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act or any other enactment, the quorum of any Tribunal,\u00a0Commission of inquiry (including any appeal Tribunal\nestablished for the purpose of hearing any appeal arising therefrom) shall not be less than two (including the Chairman):\nProvided that the Chairman and the member shall be present at every sitting of the Tribunal, Commission of inquiry throughout the\n51\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n64/179\nduration of the trial or hearing.\"\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that on the face of the provision of Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution as amended stating:-\n\"(4) The Interpretation Act shall apply for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of this Constitution.\"\nthe window for quorum for the sitting of the Code of Conduct Tribunal in proceedings in exercise of its jurisdiction opened under Section 28 of the Interpretation Act,\nis solidly on the ground for the effective functioning of the Tribunal as rightly found by the Tribunal and affirmed on appeal by the Court below. In other words, the Code\nof Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted with the Chairman and one member only when it exercised its jurisdiction in proceedings for the hearing and\ndetermination of the Appellant's Objection to the competence of the Code of Conduct Tribunal to try him for his conduct in contravention of the stated provisions of\nthe Code of Conduct for Public Officers on 18/9/2015. I therefore resolve this issue against the Appellant.\nWith regard to issue number three in the Appellant's brief of argument, learned Senior Counsel to the Appellant decided\n52\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n65/179\nto put the question thus:-\n\"(3) Having regard to the wording of Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act CAP C.15 2004, whether the 13 Count-Charge preferred against\nthe Appellant by someone other than the Attorney-General of the Federation is competent.\"\nThe stand of the Appellant on this issue is that it is incontestable that Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal\u00a0Act, 2004, which requires prior\nauthorization of the Attorney-General of the Federation before breaches of the Code of Conduct for Public Officers can be charged to Court has rebutted the\npresumption of authorization by a Law Officer to file the charges. Learned Senior Counsel emphasized that Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and\nTribunal \u00a0Act CAP C.15 and Paragraph 18 of the Schedule to the said Act, are specific provisions on the requirements on how a charge can or should be initiated at the\nCode of Conduct Tribunal and that these specific provisions take precedence in Law over the general stipulations provided in Sections 2 and 4 of the Law Officers Act\nCAP L8 Laws of the Federation which merely authorized Law Officers to act on the\n53\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n66/179\ninstruction of the Solicitor-General in the absence of a sitting Attorney-General so that the activities of the Ministry does not grind to a hault. The case of JACK\nv.\u00a0UNAM (2004) 5 NWLR (pt.865) 208 at 229, was relied upon in support of this argument of learned Senior Counsel who concluded that the 13 count charge filed in the\nabsence of a sitting Attorney-General of the Federation against the Appellant before the Code of Conduct Tribunal without specific authorization of the Attorney-\nGeneral of the Federation, is null and void.\nFor the Respondent, its learned Senior Counsel heavily supported the findings of the majority decision of the Court below that the Office of the Attorney-General of\nthe Federation is an existing office under the Constitution; that the Solicitor-General of the Federation is by virtue of Section 4 of the Law Officers Act, 2004,\nempowered to exercise the function of the Attorney-General prescribed in Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act whenever there is no\nsitting Attorney-General; that M.S. Hassan was authorized by the Solicitor-General of the Federation to file the charge against the Appellant; that by\n54\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n67/179\nSection 174(1) and (2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended, M.S. Hassan or any Officer in the Department of Attorney-General's office is empowered to initiate\nCriminal proceedings unless it is proved otherwise. It was the argument of the learned Senior Counsel for the Respondent that these findings by the Court of Appeal\nnow on appeal, cannot be faulted as they are supported by the Constitution, the Acts of the National Assembly and many; Judicial pronouncements and therefore\nurged the Court to find against the Appellant on this issue.\nThe resolution of this issue lies squarely in the provision of Section 24(1) and (2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act 2004, and its Third Schedule\nthereto, the Law Officers Act CAP L.8 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 Sections 2 and 4 thereof and Section 174(1) and (2) of the Constitution of the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria 1999 as amended.\nSection 24(1) and (2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act states:-\n\"24(1) The Rules of procedure to be adopted in any prosecution for the offences under this Act, before the Tribunal, and the forms to be used in such prosecution shall\nbe as set out\n55\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n68/179\nin the Third Schedule to this Act.\n(2) Prosecution for all offences under this Act shall be instituted in the name of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the Attorney-General of the Federation or such\nOfficers in the Federal Ministry of Justice as the Attorney-General of the Federation may authorize so to do.\"\nFrom the above Sub-Section (2) of the Section, it is quite plain that prosecution for the offences under the Act shall be instituted by the Attorney-General of the\nFederation or such Officers of his Ministry as the Attorney-General, may authorize to prosecute. Although it is not in dispute between the parties that there was no\nsitting Attorney-General of the Federation at the time and date when a Deputy Director from the Federal Ministry of Justice was authorized by the Solicitor-General of\nthe Federation to initiate the proceeding against the Appellant now being challenged in this appeal, the fact that the provisions of Sections 2 and 4 of the Law\nOfficers Act, 2004 and Section 174(1) and (2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended, have clearly sanctioned what took place before the Code of Conduct Tribunal is\nnot at all in doubt. In particular\n56\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n69/179\nSection 174(1) and (2)\u00a0of the Constitution as amended reads:-\n\"174(1) The Attorney-General of the Federation shall have powers:-\n(a) To institute and undertake Criminal proceedings against any person before any Court of Law in Nigeria other than Court Martial in respect of any offence created by\nor under any Act of the National Assembly.\n(b) To take over and continue any such Criminal proceedings that may have been instituted by any other authority or persons; and\n(c) To discontinue at any stage before Judgment is delivered any such Criminal proceedings instituted or undertaken by him or any other authority or person.\n2. The powers conferred upon the Attorney-General of the Federation under Sub-Section (1) of this Section may be exercised by him in person or through officers of\nhis Department.\"\nSub-Section (2) of Section 174 of the 1999 Constitution quoted above is quite clear and unambiguous. It has provided that even in the absence of a sitting Attorney-\nGeneral of the Federation, Officers of his Department such as the Deputy Director from the Federal Ministry of Justice who signed and filed the 13 counts charge\nagainst the\n57\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n70/179\nAppellant, can initiate the proceedings of prosecution before the Code of Conduct Tribunal against the Appellant, notwithstanding the specific provisions of Section\n24(2) of the Code of Conduct Act, 2004, relied upon by the Appellant. This is because the Law is trite that the provisions of the Constitution override any other\nprovisions in any Act of the National Assembly. See FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA v. ADEWUNMI (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt.1042) 399 at 418-419. On the whole therefore, it\nwould appear that the complaint of the Appellant in this issue against the majority decision of the Court below is rather misconceived resulting in this issue being\nresolved against the Appellant.\nIn the result, having resolved the two main issues in this appeal against the Appellant, I am of the strong view that the Court below was right in its unanimous decision\nthat the Code of Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted when it heard and determined the issues that culminated in the Tribunal's Ruling of 18/9/2015, with the\nChairman and one other member or person of the Tribunal. I am equally of the strong view that the Court below was on firm ground in its majority decision\n58\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n71/179\nthat the 13 count charge preferred against the Appellant before the Code of Conduct Tribunal and signed by M.S. Hassan, a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of\nJustice, was competent notwithstanding that there was no sitting Attorney-General of the Federation at the date and time it was initiated.\nIt is for the above reasons and more comprehensive reasons on the main and other issues resolved contained in the lead Judgment of my learned brother Onnoghen\nJSC., which I have had the opportunity of reading before today and with which I entirely agree that this appeal must be dismissed. Accordingly, I also hereby dismiss the\nappeal.\nIBRAHIM TANKO MUHAMMAD, J.S.C.: The issues formulated by the appellant in this appeal are as set out below:\u00a0\n\"ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION\n13. Whether the majority decision of Court of Appeal Abuja Division was right in the interpretation of the Constitution when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal\nwas properly constituted in law when it\u00a0sat on 18/9/2015 with just the Chairman and one (1) other member in contravention of the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the\n5th Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as amended\n59\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n72/179\nto exercise the powers and jurisdiction vested by the 1999 Constitution and if the answer is in the negative, whether the charge and the entire proceedings inclusive of\nthe Ruling in issue is not null and void and of no consequence?

Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal was correct in law when it held that notwithstanding the lack of proper service on the appellant of the criminal\nsummons to appear before the Code of Conduct Tribunal on the 18th of September, 2015, such a vice was a mere irregularity cured by the appearance of the appellant\n60\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n73/179\nat the proceedings regardless at the existence of appellants conditional appearance on protest? (ISSUE NO 4) (GROUND 5)\n17. Whether the majority decision of the Court below was right when it justified the refusal of the Code of Conduct Tribunal to obey the Federal High Court to appear\nbefore it and show cause why it should not order a stay of further proceedings on the ground that the order in issue was not one specifically asking the lower Tribunal\nto stay its proceedings? (ISSUE No. 5) (GROUND 6)\n18. Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal was correct when it\u00a0held that the Code of conduct Tribunal was a criminal Court empowered to apply the\nAdministration of Criminal Justice Act? (ISSUE NO. 6) (GROUND 7).\"\nThe respondent couched issues it considered more relevant to the appeal as follows:\n1) \"Whether the Court of Appeal was not right in its unanimous decision when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted when it heard and\ndetermined the issues that culminated in the Tribunal's ruling of 18th September, 2015 with the Chairman and one other member. (See Grounds 1 and 2 of the Notice at\nAppeal at pages\n61\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n74/179\n1268- 1278 of the record)\n2) Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal, though a Court of limited criminal jurisdiction, was competent to issue a\nbench warrant against the appellant in the event of his failure to appear before it (see ground 3 of the Notice of Appeal)\n3) Whether the Court of Appeal was not right in its majority decision when it held that the charge preferred against the appellant before the Code of Conduct Tribunal\nand signed by M. S Hassan. A Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Justice was competent notwithstanding that there was no sitting Attorney General of the\nFederation at the tine it was initiated (see ground 4 of the Notice of Appeal)\n4) Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that the issue of the alleged irregularity in the service of summons on the appellant to appear before the\nCode of Conduct Tribunal on 18th September, 2015, was not fatal to the proceedings before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (see Grounds 5 and 7 of the Notice of\nAppeal)\n5) Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that since the Federal High Court did not make\n62\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n75/179\nany order on 17th September, 2015 restraining the Code of Conduct Tribunal from sitting, the issue of disobedience of that order or the superiority of the Federal High\nCourt to the Tribunal would not arise (see ground 6 of the notice of appeal).\"\nMy Lords, by taking a careful perusal at the issues it is my observation that the issues formulated by the respondent can conveniently fuse into appellants issues. I\nthink I should start with issue No.2(14) on the competence of the Tribunal to issue a bench warrant against the appellant. \u00a0This issue, to my mind, is no more a live issue.\nIt is far spent since the time the Tribunal discharged that order. On the 22nd of September, 2015 when the appellant was physically present in the Tribunal and his plea\ntaken on all the 13 counts, the defence applied that the bench warrant issued against the appellant be discharged. The Tribunal there and then, stated:\n\"Bench Warrant discharged.\"\nAlthough no elaborate reason was stated by the Tribunal for discharging its order for issuance and execution of the bench warrant against the appellant it is not\nunconnected\u00a0I believe, with the fact that the appellant\n63\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n76/179\nput up physical appearance before the Tribunal on that day of 22nd September, 2015. Thus, the physical appearance of the appellant before the Tribunal, through\nwhatever means now settles the issue of the execution of the bench warrant. The bench warrant order, therefore, became spent and it\u00a0was no more a live issue.\nAlthough the Court below supported the view that the Tribunal has Criminal Jurisdiction (limited) this connotes, by drawing necessary inference, that the Tribunal was\ncompetent to issue the bench warrant as it did. All I am trying to convey is that the issue of bench warrant against the appellant is no more pursuable as same has\nbeen discharged by the tribunal itself. The Court below in my humble view, was over generous in entertaining that issue as it assumed the status of an academic\nrigmarole. I do not consider it worth spending another second on that issue, talkless of giving it any elaborate consideration. I am hereby, competently, striking out that\nissue as purely academic. This Court is always loathe in pursuing academic issues and as a Court does not make orders in vein See: Iweka v. SCOA (2000) 3 SC 21 at\n29; Ukejianya v. Uchendu\n64\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n77/179\n(1950) 12 WACA 45; Nkwocha v. Govt. of Anambra State (1984) 1 SCNLR 634.\nThe next issue in my consideration is issue No. 3 formulated by the appellant in Paragraph 15 of the appellant's brief of argument This issue challenges the competence\nof any other person (someone other) than the Attorney-General of the Federation to initiate a complaint or\u00a0proceeding against the appellant. Learned senior counsel\nfor the appellant. Mr Daudu submitted that the correct position of the law is that the extant statutory requirement for the initiation of complaint against a person\nalleged to have breached the Code of Conduct for public officers expressly requires the authorisation of a sitting Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF). He cited\nand relied on the provision of Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act. Cap C15 2004, LFN. He contends further that this legislation required\nspecifically the Attorney-General of the Federation to act personally or directly before an act can be valid. He cited the case of Matari v. Dan Galadima (1993) 2 NWLR\n(Pt.281) 266. The learned SAN contended further that notwithstanding the provisions of the Law Officers Act\n65\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n78/179\nwhich empowers the Solicitor-General of the Federation to perform the general functions of the Attorney- General in the absence of the latter, the general provisions\nof the Law Officers Act cannot override the specific provisions of Section 24 of the Code of Conduct Tribunal Act which specifically requires that only the Attorney-\nGeneral of the Federation or his direct appointee can commence proceedings before that Tribunal. The proceedings of the Tribunal did not disclose that the Solicitor-\nGeneral of the Federation exercised the powers of the Attorney-General of the Federation under the Code of Conduct Tribunal Act nor authorised any other person to\nexercise same. The majority decision of the Court below was in error when it held that the assertion of Mr. Hassan of counsel from the Bar was sufficient proof of the\nSolicitor- General's authority to prosecute. He cited the case of Jack v. Unam (2004) 5 NWLR (Pt.865) 208 at 229.\nThe learned SAN for the respondent Mr. Jacobs\u00a0made copious submissions on this issue. Some of the cardinal submissions are that the power to initiate criminal\nproceedings is conferred by the provisions of Section 174 and 211 of\u00a0the\n66\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n79/179\nConstitution and that any other law purporting to confer such power must bow to the Constitution including Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Tribunal Act. The\nConstitution he said has already covered the field as to the law governing prosecution.\u00a0He cited among others INEC v. Musa (2003) 3 NWLR (Pt.806) 72 at 158; A-G\nOgun State v A G Federation (1982) 3 NCLR 166 at\u00a0176; that the Attorney-General of any State or Federation does not have monopoly of criminal prosecution, officers in\nhis department are empowered to initiate and prosecute criminal cases; likewise other Agencies of government. Thus, Mr. M.S. Hassan can competently sign a charge as\nan officer in the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation.\u00a0The charge before the Tribunal signed by M.S. Hassan is competent in law. In similar vein, Mr Hassan by\nvirtue of Sections 2 and 4 of the Law Officers Act, Cap L8, LFN, 2004, can still be competent to initiate the charge against the appellant; Mr. Hassan, as Solicitor-\nGeneral of the Federation stepped into the shoes of the Attorney-General of the Federation to exercise the power to initiate criminal proceedings before the Code of\nConduct Tribunal\n67\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n80/179\nsince there was no sitting Attorney General. The learned SAN urged this Court to resolve this issue in favour of the respondent.\nMy Lords, it is worth clarifying from the outset to state that the legal profession in this country by orientation owes its allegiance to the English legal system. But the\ncurrent political dispensation via the Constitution largely aligns more with the Untied States practice. An Attorney-General in England is the principal law officer of the\nCrown, and head of the bar in England. The Federal Attorney-General in the United States of America is the head of the Department of Justice and Chief Law Officer of\nthe Federal Government who represents the United States in legal matter generally and gives advice and opinions to the President and to the head of the executive\ndepartments of the Government when so requested. The Attorney-General appears in person to represent the Government in the United States Supreme Court in\ncases of exceptional gravity or importance (See Blacks Law Dictionary, fifth ed.p.118) In the United States dispensation the Solicitor- General at the United States is in-\ncharge of representing the Government in the\n68\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n81/179\nSupreme Court. He decides what cases the Government should ask the Supreme Court to review and what position the Government should take in cases before the\nCourt. He supervises the preparation of Government's Supreme Court briefs and other legal documents and the conduct of the oral arguments in the Court and argues\nmost of the important cases himself. The Solicitor-General's duties also include deciding whether the United States should appeal in all cases it losses before the\nLower Courts.\nIn our federal Constitution, 1999 (as amended), it is provided as follows:\n\"The Attorney-General of the Federation shall have power.\na) to institute and undertake criminal proceedings against any person before any Court of law in Nigeria other than Court Martial in respect of any offence created by\nor under any Act at the National Assembly.\nb) to take over and continue any such criminal proceedings that may have been instituted by any other authority or person; and\nc) to discontinue at any stage before Judgment is delivered any such criminal proceedings instituted or undertaken by him at any other authority or person.\nd) the powers conferred\n69\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n82/179\nupon the Attorney-General of the Federation under Subsection (1) at this Section may be exercised by him in person OR THROUGH OFFICERS OF HIS DEPARTMENT '\n(Emphasis supplied Section 174 of the Constitution)\nThe bone of contention between the appellant and the respondent on this issue is, primary, on whether the Tribunal has any criminal jurisdiction and whether the\nallegations made against the appellant were criminal in nature.\nThere is a finding by the Court below as follows:\n\"The Tribunal is a Court with specific criminal jurisdiction. In a sense, because of the provisions of Paragraph 18(3) of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended), the criminal jurisdiction of the Tribunal has the inherent powers of a Court of criminal jurisdiction...\"\nAs of now, the above finding of the Court below has not been set aside. It is a binding statement of the law. Therefore, the provisions of Section 174 of the Constitution\napplies forcefully to the proceedings of the Tribunal. The Attorney-General of the Federation is competent to initiate any criminal proceeding before the Tribunal in\nrespect of\n70\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n83/179\nthe allegations made against the appellant. \u00a0He can equally exercise such power by himself in person or through any officer of his department.\nThe issue of whether any other person apart from the Attorney-General of the Federation is empowered to initiate a criminal proceeding has been commented upon\nby both the trial Tribunal and the Court below. The trial Tribunal made the following finding:\n''It is the believe (sic 'belief') of this Tribunal that the powers to initiate proceedings are further enhanced by the provisions of Section 2 and Section 4 of the Law\nOfficers' Act, Cap L8, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria. In the absence of Attorney- General, the Solicitor- General of (sic: 'or') any other officer in the chambers of\nthe Attorney- General can exercise such powers or duties of the Attorney- General relating to institution of criminal proceedings. See also Section 24(3) of the Code\nof Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act Cap C15, 2004 which said prosecutions for all offences referred to in this Act shall be instituted in the name of the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria by the Attorney- General or such officers in the Federal Ministry of Justice as\n71\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n84/179\nthe Attorney- General may authorise.\"\nIn agreeing with the above finding, the Court below, remarked,inter alia:\n\"The office of the Attorney-General of the Federation is a Constitutional or Statutory office created by Section 150 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of\nNigeria 1999 (as amended). Unless this office is abolished through the instrumentality of amendment of the relevant provisions of the Constitution, the office like a\ncontinum, remains in existence as an artificial or juristic person. Although, the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation does not die, and indeed has not died,\nthe duties and functions of the Attorney-General of the Federation must be carried out or performed by a biological person or natural person, as only a human being\ncan legally and logically occupy the said exalted office. That the office of the Attorney- General does not die, unless abrogated by a Constitutional amendment, see:\nAttorney-General of the Federation v. All Nigeria Peoples Party & 2 Ors (2003) 18 NWLR (Pt 851) 182 at 249. pet Tobi, JSC.. .\nI agree that in the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation, the\n72\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n85/179\nSolicitor-General of the Federation may perform his duties and shall have the same powers as are 'imposed by the law on the Attorney-General of the Federation.' See:\nSection 4 of the Law Officers' Act, 2004 ... The provisions of Section 174(1)(a) and (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended)\nare broad enough to justify Mr. M. S. Hassan, a Deputy Director in the office at the Attorney-General of the Federation to institute the proceedings against the appellant\nin the Tribunal.\"\nBy Court below's affirmation as above of the findings by the Tribunal, the issue of subrogating the Attorney-General of the Federation by an officer in his office has now\nbecome a concurrent finding of fact which requires special circumstances to warrant this Court to tamper with such a finding. No such special circumstances have\nbeen placed before me to make me interfere. I am therefore, loathe to interfere See: Onwugbufor v. Okoye (1996) 1 NWLR (Pt.424) 252; Olatunde v. Abidogun (2001) 18\nNWLR (Pt.746) 712: Amayo v. State (2001) 15 NWLR (Pt.745) 251; Obasohan v Omorodion (2001) 13 NWLR (Pt.729) 206.\nIn any event, my noble lords, it appears\n73\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n86/179\nridiculous to pursue the argument that where there is no person occupying the office of the Attorney- General of the Federation, activities in the office such as\nprosecution of offences in the law Courts would grind to a halt. That office, as rightly stated by the Court below, is a creature of the Constitution or a Statute. It is the\nsame Constitution/Statute that delegated the functions or activities of the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation to some other persons such as the\nSolicitor-General or other officers in the Ministry. The point raised by the learned SAN for the appellant that in order to comply with Section 24(2) of the Code of\nConduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, 2004,\u00a0the Attorney-General of the Federation is the one required to specifically sign the charge or be available to give consent to\nthe law officer that will sign the charge even if that law officer is the Solicitor-General The Court below adequately and frontally answered this poser in the following\nwords:\n\"I do not agree with the contention of the learned senior counsel for the appellant that consent to sign or institute prosecution must be physically delegated to the\n74\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n87/179\nSolicitor-General of the Federation or any other law officer of the Federation. This is because Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act cannot\nbe read in isolation of the clear provisions of Section 4 of the Law Officers' Act. The right to perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Attorney-General of\nthe Federation by the Solicitor-General, in the absence of the former, has statutory backing and to require physical consent is a requirement that is merely a\nsurplussage.\nThe Solicitor-General of the Federation while performing the duties and exercising the powers of the Attorney-General of the Federation, in the absence of the latter,\ncan also do so through any law officer in the Federal Ministry of Justice. The law is that there is a presumption that 'any officer in any department of the Attorney-\nGeneral's office is empowered to initiate criminal proceeding unless it is proved otherwise.' See: Federal Republic of Nigeria v. Senator Olawole Julius Adewunmi (2007)\n10 NWLR (Pt 1042) 399 at 418 per Kalgo, JSC.\nThe presumption to initiate the prosecution in the Tribunal in favour of Mr. M. S. Hassan has not been rebutted by the\n75\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n88/179\nappellant in this case.\"\nMy lords, it is clear from the Records of Appeal that at the time\u00a0proceedings were initiated to prosecute the appellant at the Tribunal, there was no person occupying\nthe office of the Attorney-General of the Federation. Mr. Hassan who appeared before the Tribunal to prosecute the appellant to the Tribunal in his words:\n\"In the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Solicitor-General can perform such powers as the Attorney-General. The Solicitor-General is in office\nand I am authorised to file this action.\"\nThis was an information coming from a learned counsel who was speaking from the Bar, and who, as a Minister in the temple of justice, would always be expected to say\nnothing but the truth. Was he disproved? There is no finding to that effect. Thus, the presumption of regularity must work in favour of the learned counsel. Mr. Hassan\nand there was no basis for the Tribunal to disbelieve or ignore such information from a gentleman of the Bar.\nFrom the tenor of Sections 174 and 211 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended), initiating criminal proceedings by the State\n76\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n89/179\n(whether federal or a State government), has been adequately covered by the Constitution. Where the doctrine of covering the field is in vogue in the Constitution any\nother legislation on the same field whether by the Federal/State government must bow to the dictate of the Constitution. That other law/legislation, if not repugnant\nmust be supplemental or subsidiary to the constitutional provision see INEC v. Musa (2003) 3 NWLR (Pt.806) 72 at pp 158; 203 - 205; A- G Ogun State v A. G.\nFederation (1982) 3 NCLR 166 at p.176; A-G Abia State v. A-G Federation (2002) 6 NWLR (Pt.763) 264 at pp. 391 - 392.\nMy lords, delegation of the powers of the Attorney-General whether of the Federation or State as donated to him by the Constitution, to officers of his Ministry or to\nAgencies such as the Police, the code of conduct Bureau,Economic and Financial Crimes Commission the Customs the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC),\nthe National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) and even to private legal practitioners, to initiate criminal proceedings against any person alleged to have\ncommitted an offence, is not strange or a novelty. This Court per Belgore,\n77\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n90/179\nJSC (as he then was later, CJN) (retired), did observe as follows\n\"It is clear from the provision of Section 160 of the 1979 Constitution that the Attorney-Generals powers or public prosecution is not exclusive;\u00a0 the 'any other\nauthority or person' in Subsection (1) can institute and undertake criminal proceedings. The Central Bank of Nigeria and the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation are\nalso authorities that can Institute criminal proceedings under Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Decree 1994.\"\nSee the case of Comptroller of Prisons v. Adekanye (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt 790) 318 at p.329. Again in the year 2006 the same Belgore, in the case of FRN v. Osahon (2006)\n5 NWLR (Pt.973) 361 at p.406, held:\n\"Police authority can, by virtue of the aforementioned provisions of Section 174(1) of the Constitution prosecute any criminal suit either through his legally qualified\nofficers or through any counsel they may engage for the purpose (see Comptroller General v. Adekanye). Any other authority or persons can definitely institute criminal\nprosecution. The power of the Attorney-General of the Federation or of the State\n78\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n91/179\nare not exclusive, any other person or authority can prosecute. However, the Attorney-General can take over or continue the prosecution from any such authority or\npersons. He can also discontinue by way of nolle prosequi.\nOne year later, i.e in 2007 in FRN v Adewunmi (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt 1042) 399 at pp 418 - 419, this Court dealt specifically with the constitutional provisions, i.e.\nSection 174 and 211 of the current Constitution:\n\"There is no doubt at all that the power to institute criminal proceedings against any person in the 1999 Constitution lies on the Attorney-General of the State of the\nFederation\u00a0as the case may be, but such power may be exercised by the Attorney-General himself or through any officers in his department. See Sections 174 and 211\nof the 1999\u00a0Constitution. These sections though very familiar in content do not require that the officer can only exercise the power to initiate criminal proceedings if\nthe Attorney-General expressly donated his power to them. The provisions of this section presumed that any officer in any department of the Attorney-General's\noffice is empowered to initiate criminal proceedings unless it is proved otherwise. This will not be conflict with our decision in A-G\n79\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n92/179\nKaduna State v. Hassan (1985) 2 NWLR (Pt.8) 483, where the main controversy was that there was no incumbent Attorney-General who could have donated the\npower to discontinue criminal prosecution in the case concerned. There is also no doubt in my mind that Mrs. Fatunde, an Assistant Chief Legal officer in the Federal\nMinistry of Justice, D.P.P. office, is an officer in one of the department of the Attorney-General of the Federation and is highly qualified to initiate criminal proceedings\nagainst the respondent. She has therefore validly and properly, in my view signed the amended charge filed on 27th October, 1999.\"\n(underlining for emphasis)\nThe effect of the absence of an Attorney-General from office (i.e. where his office is vacant), this Court clarified the issue in no uncertain terms. It was held, inter alia\n\"Chief Olanipekun, SAN seriously attacked the appellant on the ground that at the time he appealed, the office of the Attorney-General was vacant and that meant that\nthe Attorney-General was dead legally. It took so much time to cite authorities particularly on the expression dead to buttress the point that it does not mean in the\ncontext physical cessation\n80\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n93/179\nof breath in medical palace. Section 150(1) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of\u00a0Nigeria 1999 creates the office of Attorney-General of the Federation. Let\nme read it quickly ... It would appear that the Attorney-General is the only Minister specifically created in the Constitution. Section 147(1) of the Constitution\nominously create the office of Minister of the Government of the Federation. In view of the fact that the office is created in the Constitution, and unless or until the\noffice is abrogated, it will continue in perpetuity. And any suit by or against the Attorney-General will in law be absorbed by the office, which never dies unless the\nConstitution abrogates it. At the time the appellant, the Attorney-General, filed the appeal, the office was and is in existence. It is very much alive and not dead as\ncontended by Chief Olanipekun.\"\nSee: A-G Federation v. ANPP (2003) 18 NWLR (Pt 851) 182 at p.209.\nThus, the absence of an Attorney-General from office either on the basis of non-appointment of one or on the basis of infirmity of body or mind of the occupant of\nthat office, that office must remain alive and active. Assignments\n81\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n94/179\nplaced on the office by the Constitution or other statutes must not stagnate but must be carried out by other competent officers of the office. Mr. Hassan is one of\nsuch competent officers of the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation. He can competently sign a charge as he actually did. The charge before the tribunal\nsigned by Mr. Hassan, in my humble view is valid and competent in law.\nAs a complimentary law to the provisions of the Constitution in relation to initiation of proceedings by the Attorney-General. (Section 174 of the Constitution)\nSections 2 and 4 of the Law Officers' Act, the Solicitor-General of the Federation can competently step into the shoes of the Attorney-General of the Federation to\nexercise the power to initiate criminal proceedings before the Code of Conduct Tribunal since there was no sitting Attorney General.\nThe Sections provide as follows:\n''2. The offices of the Attorney-General and Solicitor General and State counsel are hereby created\n4. The Solicitor-General of the Federation in the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation may perform any of the duties and shall have the same powers as\nare\n82\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n95/179\nimposed by law on the Attorney-General of the Federation.\"\nThe Law Officers' Act details the matter of delegation of powers conferred on the Attorney General of the Federation by statute, on the Solicitor-General of the\nFederation whenever there is no incumbent Attorney-General in office as in the present case. By necessary intendments, both Section 4 of the Law Officers Act and\nSection 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau Tribunal Act are not opposed to each other but complementary in that whenever there is no Attorney-General in\noffice, the Solicitor-General is empowered to exercise the functions or powers conferred by Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act on the\nAttorney-General of the Federation.\nThe issue of proof whether Mr. Hassan was authorised by the Solicitor-General of the Federation to sign the charge before the tribunal, is largely dependent on the\nevidential proof demanded by the Evidence Act (Sections 131 and 132), as he who asserts must prove. It is to be noted from the records, that neither the appellant nor\nthe tribunal demanded for any letter of authority from Mr. Hassan authorising him to sign the charge from\n83\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n96/179\nthe Solicitor-General. In any event, it is not the usual practice of the Courts to demand letter of authority authorising a counsel such as Mr. Hassan to sign the charge\nbefore the tribunal. In fact, there is no statutory duty imposed on the person filing a charge to produce any evidence of his authority at\u00a0the time of filing the charge or\nat arraignment. Comptroller NPS v. Adekanye (No.1) (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt.790) 318 at 328; Bode George v. FRN (2011) 10 NWLR\u00a0(Pt.1254) at p.66. In Nnakwe v. State\n(2013) 18 NWLR (Pt.1385) 1 at p27, this Court observed:\n\"The same principle was earlier applied by this Court in the case of Compt. NPS v Adekanye (No.1) (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt.790) 318. This was a case where the\nrespondents were prosecuted by a private legal practitioner on behalf of the Federal Government. Upon objection raised by the respondents' counsel, the Court of\nAppeal sought for the production of the fiat by counsel to the Federal Government. On further appeal to this Court, a presumption of authority was held in favour of a\ncounsel who announces appearance for a party, notwithstanding that\n84\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n97/179\nhe possesses a fiat or a letter of instruction. It was further held that the presumption of authority can only be rebutted by hard evidence adduced by the other party;\nthis from all indications has not been shown to be the case in the present appeal. Rather, and from the available evidence, it is on record that the Attorney-General of\nthe Federation did authorise and ratify the preferment at the said count 4. There is no contrary evidence to this fact which can only be debunked by producing such as\nclearly restated in Adekanye's case (supra).\"\nMy lords, the presumption of regularity is sacrosant. Where a legal practitioner informs the Court that he was authorised (as did Mr.\u00a0Hassan), the Court/tribunal must\nbelieve the counsel. It is left for the party challenging him to prove otherwise. See Comptroller of Prisons v. Adekanye (supra), page 330 B-D.\nI am still of the firm view that both Mr. Hassan and the tribunal, did the right thing.\nI now turn to the thorny issue of whether the tribunal was properly constituted when it sat on 18/9/15 with the Chairman and one other member to exercise powers and\njurisdiction vested on it by the Constitution.\n85\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n98/179\nYour lordships, it is not in dispute that when the tribunal sat on the 18th day of September, 2015 to take the plea of the appellant, the tribunal was constituted by the\nChairman and one other member of the tribunal. Paragraph 15 of Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, establishes the Code of Conduct Tribunal. It provides:\n\"15(1) There shall be established a tribunal to be known as Code of Conduct Tribunal which shall consist of a Chairman and two other persons.\"\n(underlining for emphasis)\nIt is the submission of Mr Daudu, learned SAN, for the appellant that it is the Constitution (grund norm) that created the Code of Conduct Tribunal and specified how\nits membership is to be constituted for it to assume jurisdiction and exercise its powers. According to the provision of Paragraph 15 of the Fifth Schedule of the\nConstitution, in\u00a0its literal and ordinary interpretation, it follows that for the Code of Conduct Tribunal to be legally functional, there must be at least three persons\ninclusive of its chairman. Where for any reason, the Tribunal falls short of its member composition, the deficiency in\u00a0membership goes to its roots and renders the\nTribunal\n86\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n99/179\nsterile and this impotence can only be remedied by the addition of a new member to bring it in conformity with the Constitutional requirement. He submitted further\nthat Paragraph 15(1) referred to above is both the composition and the quorum of the Tribunal. There must be valid composition of the Tribunal before the question of\nquorum can arise. The composition and the quorum in this instance are the same and the number is three. The learned SAN contended that the Court below was wrong\nin holding that the Code of Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted when it sat with only its Chairman and one other member in hearing and determining the issues\nwhich culminated in its ruling of 18th September, 2015. He urged this Court to discountenance all the authorities cited by the respondent and resolve this issue in\nappellant's favour.\nLearned SAN for the respondent, Mr. Jacobs started his submission by quoting extensively from the decision of the Court below on the position of the Constitution of\nthe Code of Conduct Tribunal when it sat on 18/09/2015. That Court held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted. He urged us to uphold the\nreasoning of\n87\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n100/179\nthat Court. He argued further that the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the Fifth Schedule to the 1999 Constitution is very clear and unambiguous which requires no\nmore than to expand those words in their natural and ordinary sense.\nThe learned SAN submitted that it is not the intendment of the legislature that the three (3) members who are to make up the Code of Conduct Tribunal must sit\ntogether at all times and that Paragraph 15(1) of the Fifth Schedule is merely the establishment section. He dwelt on the semantics of \"Consist of\" and \"Quorum of\".\nThat the paragraph has not provided what the quorum of that tribunal should be. He drew comparative analysis between that paragraph and some provisions of the\nConstitution such as Sections 237, 249, 255, 270 and 285. He drew this Court's attention to Section 28 of the Interpretation Act in order to determine the quorum of\nthe tribunal. He submitted that by virtue of the provision of Section 28 of the Interpretation Act, the Chairman and one other member shall be sufficient to form a\nquorum of any tribunal including the Code of Conduct Tribunal. He urged this Court to resolve this issue in favour of the\n88\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n101/179\nrespondent.\nIn his reply brief, the learned SAN for the appellant responded to some points of law/new points raised in the respondent's brief He replied that the respondent\ndeliberately ignores the provision of Paragraph 12 of the 3rd Schedule to the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act which requires the signature of the\nChairman and not less than two other members of the tribunal including the person who took down the notes\u00a0at the conclusion of each day's proceedings That\nindicates according to the learned SAN for the appellant, the intention of the legislature to have not less than three members of the Tribunal to sit at each days\nproceeding. The words of Paragraph 15(1) of Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and Section 20(1) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, 2004, are\ndevoid of any ambiguity as to their purport. Recourse cannot be had to any other piece of legislation to ascertain the true intention of the legislature in that respect.\nThat Section 285(3) and (4) of the Constitution are specific to election tribunals. It is only if deserving cases, where any gap, lacuna or mischief, exists that resort may\nbe had to the interpretation\n89\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n102/179\nAct. Relating his arguments to the principles of fair hearing, the learned SAN argued that the sitting of the two man panel of the Tribunal raises a serious issue of breach\nof the 1999 Constitution on fair hearing as provided by Section 36 thereof. The learned SAN posed this question \"Where there is a tie or disagreement on issues\nrelevant to adjudication between Hon. Chairman Umar and Hon member Atedze, who breaks the tie or deadlock?\" He concluded that the Tribunal as composed or\nconstituted cannot secure its independence and impartiality.\nMy lords, in the course of considering this issue, I set out earlier the provision of Paragraph 15(1) of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution. It is generally accepted in\nlegal circles that a Schedule to any enactment forms part of that enactment NNPC v. Famfa Oil Ltd (2012) 17 NWLR (Pt 1328) 148. This Paragraph 15(1) of the Fifth\nSchedule of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) forms part and parcel of that Constitution.\nIn interpreting provisions of the Constitution or indeed any statute, the settled principle is that where the words used are devoid of ambiguity, same must be given\nnatural meaning. In other words,\n90\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n103/179\nwhere the words used are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary meaning. See:\u00a0Dangana v. Usman (2013) 6 NWLR (Pt.1349) 50 at page\n93 B-D: Amadi v. INEC (2013) 4 NWLR (Pt.1345) 595 at pages 633 D - F and 634 - 635 H-C. Thus, the plan and ordinary meaning of the words, used in\u00a0Paragraph\n15(1) of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution, to my humble understanding, is that the composition of the Tribunal in its highest or full capacity is when it consists of\na Chairman and two (2) other persons making the composition to be three. That, in my view, relates to composition or constitution of the Tribunal. That composition\nmay even be less than three but it cannot be more than three. This properly tallies with other provisions of the Constitution such as the composition or Constitution\nsections relating to Courts of law as established by the Constitution e.g Sections 234, 247, 252, 263 and 268. In all the Sections of the Constitution cited above, each\nsection has a correlating section which provides quorum for the particular Court. Even the Election Tribunal\u00a0itself has a composition section as well as quorum section\nseparately established\n91\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n104/179\nby the Constitution. For instance, Section 285(4) of the Constitution provides:\n\"The quorum of an Election Tribunal established under this Section shall be the Chairman and one other member.\"\n(underlining for emphasis)\nParagraph 15(1) of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution has not, in my view, made any separate provision for the quorum of the Code of Conduct Tribunal for the\npurpose of the Tribunals sitting. In an attempt to justify that quorum for the Code of Conduct Tribunal must not be anything less than three (3). i.e Chairman and two\n(2) other persons (members), the learned SAN for the appellant placed reliance on the provision of Paragraph 12 of the Third Schedule to the Code of Conduct\nBureau and Tribunal Act which requires the signature of:\n''the Chairman and not less than two other members of the Tribunal including the person who took down the notes, at the conclusion of each day's proceedings.\"\nNow, the provision of Paragraph 12 of the Third Schedule to the Tribunal's Act, states:\n''The Chairman or\u00a0any other member of the Tribunal authorised by the Chairman in that behalf shall, in every case, take notes in writing of\n92\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n105/179\nthe oral evidence, or so much thereof as he considers material, in a book to be kept for that purpose and such book shall be signed by the Chairman and not less than\ntwo other members of the tribunal including the person who took down the notes, at the conclusion of each days proceedings.\"\n(underlining for emphasis)\nMy lords, the title of the Third Schedule of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act Cap 56 LFN 1990 (replicated in Cap C15, LFN, 2004) states:\n\"CODE OF CONDUCT TRIBUNAL RULES OF PROCEDURE - commencement and conduct of Trial.\"\nIt is thus clear, that the Third Schedule of the Tribunal's Act is not on establishment or constitution of the tribunal. It is neither on quorum of the Tribunal. It provided\nfor what may be regarded as Rules of Court. The time honoured principle of law is that wherever and whenever the Constitution speaks any provision of an Act/Statute,\non the same subject matter, must remain silent. See: INEC v. Musa (2003) 3 NWLR (Pt.806) 72; A-G Ogun State v. A-G Federation (1982) 2 NCLR 166.\nIt is my belief that Paragraph 12 of the said Third Schedule is on rules of procedure which cannot override the\n93\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n106/179\nprovisions of Section 318(4) and the Fifth Schedule of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), or even override other statutory provisions such as Section 28 of the\nInterpretation Act which specifies the quorum for Tribunals such the trial Tribunal. Section 318(4) of the Constitution provides:\n\"The Interpretation Act shall apply for the purpose of interpreting the provisions of this Constitution.\"\nThus, as paragraph 15 of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution omitted to make categoric provision on what shall form the quorum of the Tribunal, there is a gap, a\nlacunae which exists. The usual practice of the Courts is to fill in the gap/lacunae as may appear appropriate to the Court by the importation of any relevant\nlegislation/law to blow life or resuscitate the otherwise dead/dormant piece of legislation. That\u00a0 is what necessitated resort to the provision of Section 28 of the\nInterpretation Act. This harmless Section provides that:\n\"Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act or any other enactments, the quorum of any tribunal, Commission of Inquiry (including any appeal tribunal established\nfor the purpose of hearing any appeal arising\n94\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n107/179\ntherefrom) shall not be less than two (including the chairman):\nProvided that the chairman and the member shall be present at every sitting of the tribunal, Commission of Inquiry throughout the duration of the trial or hearing.\"\n(underlining for emphasis)\nI am of the firm view that by virtue of the provision of Section 28 of the Interpretation Act as set out above, the chairman and one other member shall be sufficient to\nform a quorum of any tribunal including the Code of Conduct Tribunal. So in determining the issue of quorum of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, resort can conveniently\nbe made to the provisions of the Interpretation Act. See: A-G Federation v. A-G Anambra State (No 2) (2012) 6 NWLR (Pt.764) 542. Thus, the effect of the provisions of\nSection 28 of the Interpretation Act is that the sitting of a Tribunal shall be valid once the chairman of the Tribunal sits with one other member of the Tribunal. In the\ncase on hand, the proceedings of the tribunal by the Chairman. Mr. Umar who sat with one other member. Mr. Atedze was validly conducted. Further, Section 28 of the\nInterpretation Act is made in such encompassing nature that it is\n95\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n108/179\napplicable \"notwithstanding anything contained in an Act/Legislation. It implies among others \"irrespective of any other provision\" the section must be enforced. It also\nmeans that the provision of the section cannot be undermined by any other provision in any other Act or enactment. In NDIC v. Okem Ent. (2004) 10 NWLR (Pt.880)\n107 at 182 this Court, per Uwaifo, JSC (rtd) stated as follows:\n\"When the term\u00a0notwithstanding\" is used in the section of a statute, it is meant to exclude an impinging or impeding effect of any other provision of the statute or other\nsubordinate legislation so that the said section may fulfil itself.\"\nSee further Olatunbosun v. NISER COUNCIL (1988) 3 NWLR (Pt. 80) 25: Ndaba (Nig.) Ltd v. UBN Plc (2009) 13 NWLR (Pt. 1158) 256 at 304.\nI am in total agreement with the Court below in its conclusion that since there is a gap in the provisions of Paragraph 15 of the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution, the\nInterpretation Act is the available legislative tool to fill this lacunae.\nI have not been convinced that the principles of fait hearing encapsulated in Section 36 of the Constitution have been violated by the tribunal\n96\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n109/179\nby its sitting with the chairman and one other member.\nMy learned brother, Onnoghen, JSC has done full justice in treating all the issues raised in this appeal. It is in agreement with him that I made the above observations.\nThe appeal certainly lacks merit. I too\u00a0dismiss it. I affirm the decision of the Court below.\nNWALI SYLVESTER NGWUTA, J.S.C.: I had a preview of the leading judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Onnoghen, JSC. I agree entirely with the reasons\nleading to the conclusion that the appeal is bereft of merit and ought to be dismissed.\nI will however make a few comments in support of the judgment.\nIt was strenuously argued on behalf of the appellant that in view of the wording of Section 24 (2) of the Code of Conduct Act, the charge preferred against the\nappellant by someone other than the Attorney-General of the Federation is incompetent and ought to have been struck out.\nSection 24 (2) of the Act relied on provides:\n\"S.24 (2). Prosecutions for all offences referred to in this Act shall be instituted in the Name of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the Attorney-General of the Federation\nor such other\n97\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n110/179\nofficer in the Federal Ministry of Justice as the Attorney General of the Federation may authorize so to do.\"\nAlso Section 174 (1) and (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) provides:\n\"(1) The Attorney-General of the Federation shall have power:\n(a) to institute and undertake criminal proceedings against any person before any Court of law in Nigeria, other than a Court Martial, in respect of any offence created\nby or under any Act of the National Assembly.\n(b)..... (c)....\n(2) The power conferred upon the Attorney-General of the Federation under Subsection (1) of this section may be exercised by him in person or through officers of his\ndepartment.\"\nAppellant does not dispute that M. S. Hassan who initiated the charge is a law officer in the Federal Ministry of Justice which is a department of the Attorney-General\nof the Federation in terms of Section 174 (2) of the Constitution (supra).\nHowever, the appellant contended that in the absence of a sitting Attorney General of the Federation, no one could have been authorized to initiate the charge.\nAttractive and logical as this argument may\n98\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n111/179\nseem on the surface, it does not represent the law as it is. The Attorney-General acts in person or through officers in his department and when a prosecution is\ninitiated by any law officer in the Ministry of Justice, it is immaterial that there is no sitting Attorney General. See The State v. Obasi (1998) 9 NWLR (Pt. 567) 686.\nOnce an information is filed against any person by a member of the department of the Attorney-General, it is taken for granted that he did so in accordance with the\ninstruction of the Attorney-General. See Christopher Awooetu v. The State (1976) R (Pt. 1) 5 at 18-20; Onwuka v. The State (1970) 1 All NLR 159; A-G Western Nigeria v.\nThe African Press Ltd & Anor (1965) 1 All NLR 9.\nIt may seem fictitious that any act of a Law officer in the Federal Ministry of Justice can be said to have been authorized by a non sitting Attorney-General or when an\nAttorney-General has not been appointed. Be that as it may, the Constitution is the embodiment of what the people desire to be their guiding light in governance. It is\nthe supreme law, the fountain of all laws. See Federal Republic of Nigeria v. George Osahon & Ors (2006) 28 SCNJ\n99\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n112/179\n348.\nIn view of the importance of the Constitution, any of its provisions must be interpreted in such a manner to enhance its purpose. In cases of ambiguity, real or\nperceived, the provision in question must be construed in such a way as to avoid what is inconvenient or absurd.\u00a0See Black's Law Dictionary Special Deluxe 5th Edn\np.234 and nothing can be more inconvenient and absurd than to say that a criminal case cannot be filed against any person in the country unless there is a sitting\nAttorney-General.\nMoreover, the Solicitor General can take over the duties of the Attorney-General if the office of the Attorney-General is vacant. See Section 4 of the Law Officers Act.\nFor the above and the fuller reasons in the lead judgment I also dismiss the appeal for want of merit.\nKUDIRAT MOTONMORI OLATOKUNBO KEKERE-EKUN, J.S.C.: I have had the privilege of reading in draft the judgment of my learned brother, Onnoghen, JSC, just delivered,\nI agree with the reasoning and conclusion that the appeal is devoid of merit and should be dismissed. His Lordship has meticulously considered and painstakingly\nresolved all the issues in\n100\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n113/179\ncontention in this appeal. However, having regard to the constitutional importance of some of the issues raised, I shall make some comments by way of emphasis and\nin support of the lead judgment.\nThe facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal have been fully set out in the lead judgment. I need not repeat them here. My comments are in respect of issues\n1 and 3 formulated by both parties, which are in pari materia and relate to the jurisdiction of the trial tribunal to hear and determine the matter before it. The said\nissues, as formulated by the appellant, read thus:\n\"1. Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal, Abuja Division was right in the interpretation of the Constitution when it held that the Code of Conduct\nTribunal was properly constituted in law when it sat on 18/09/2015 with just the Chairman and one (1) other member in contravention of the provisions of Paragraph 15\n(1) of the 5th Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as to exercise the powers and jurisdiction vested by the 1999 Constitution and if the answer is in the negative,\nwhether the charge and the entire proceedings inclusive of the Ruling in issue is not null and\n101\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n114/179\nvoid and of no consequence?\n3. Having regard to the clear wording of Section 24 (2) the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act Cap C15 2004 whether the 13 count charge preferred against\nthe appellant by someone other than the Attorney-General of the Federation is competent?\"\nIt is well settled, almost beyond the need to cite authorities, that the competence of a Court to adjudicate in a cause or matter before it depends on the following\nconditions:\na. It must be properly constituted as regards numbers and qualifications of the members of the bench, and no member is disqualified for one reason or the other;\nb. The subject matter of the case must be within its jurisdiction, and there must be no feature in the case which prevents the Court from exercising its jurisdiction; and\nc. The case must come before the Court initiated by due process of law, and upon fulfilment of any condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction.\nSee: Madukolu v. Nkemdilim (1962) 2 SCNLR 341; (1962) 1 ALL NLR 587 at 594; Skenconsult (Nig.) Ltd. v. Ukey (1981) 1 S.C. 6 at 62; Inakoju v. Adeleke (2007) 4 NWLR\n(Pt.1025) 427 at 588 F.\nThe importance of\n102\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n115/179\nissues 1 and 3 is further buttressed by the fact that it is equally trite that where the Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a cause or matter, the entire process\u00a0no matter\nhow well conducted, is an exercise in futility. The proceedings would amount to a nullity ab initio and liable to be set aside.\nWith regard to the first issue, J.B, DAUDU, SAN, learned Senior Counsel for the appellant submitted, relying on Paragraph 15 (1) and (3) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999\nConstitution (as amended), that the Code of Conduct Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as the Tribunal) in the exercise of its adjudicatory functions, is only properly\nconstituted when it consists of the Chairman and two other persons. He submitted that where, for any reason, the tribunal falls short of its three-member composition,\nthe deficiency in membership goes to its roots and renders it sterile. To fortify this argument, learned senior counsel relied on Section 20 (2) of the Code of Conduct\nBureau and Tribunal Act, Cap, C 23 LFN 2004 (hereinafter referred to as the CCBT Act), which he argued is in tandem with the Constitutional provision. He submitted\nthat contrary to the position taken\n103\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n116/179\nby the Lower Court, there is no lacuna in the provisions of Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule to the Constitution to warrant the application of the Interpretation\nAct. He submitted that the constitutional prescription of the composition of the tribunal is inviolate and cannot be circumscribed by a lesser statute such as the\nInterpretation Act. He referred to the case of: INEC v. Musa (2003) 3 NWLR (Pt. 806) 72 @ 157 - 158.\nHe argued that Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule provides for both the quorum and the constitution of the tribunal and that it puts the quorum at three. He\nposited that the use of the word \"other\" in the said provision envisages that the tribunal can have other members in excess of three but for it to be properly constituted\nthe Chairman must sit with two other members.\nHe referred to comparable provisions of the Constitution, such as Sections 234, 247, 252, 263 and 268 and contended that the word \"consist\" used in Paragraph 15 (1)\nof the 5th Schedule to the Constitution refers to the composition of the Tribunal and not its establishment. He contended that where the framers of the Constitution\nseek to define the numerical\n104\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n117/179\nstrength of Justices or Judges to exercise the powers and jurisdiction of a Court, they used the word \"consist\". He submitted further that the distinction between the\nword \"consist\" and \"quorum\" made by learned senior counsel for the respondent at the Court below is an unlawful importation into the provision. He also relied on\nParagraph 12 of the 3rd Schedule to the CCBT Act, which provides that the record of proceedings must be signed at the end of each day by the Chairman and not\nless than two other members of the Tribunal, including the person who took down the notes. He argued that if it is determined that a two-man panel is competent, in\nthe event of failure to reach a consensus on an issue, it would raise a serious issue of breach of the parties' fundamental rights to fair hearing guaranteed by Section 36\nof the 1999 Constitution, as such a composition would not secure the tribunal's independence and impartiality.\nIn response, ROTIMI JACOBS, SAN, learned senior counsel for the respondent, contended that Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th schedule is an establishment section, which\nprovides for the creation of the Code of Conduct Tribunal to be made up of\n105\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n118/179\nthree members. He submitted that the composition of the Tribunal as a body is different from its quorum and that the quorum relates to the number of members that\nmust be present before valid proceedings can take place. He maintained that Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th schedule to the Constitution and Section 20 (1) and (2) of\nthe CCBT Act have nothing to do with the quorum of the Tribunal to entertain cases. He referred to the sections of the Constitution establishing the various superior\nCourts of record e.g. Sections 249 and 237, which establish the Federal High Court and the Court of Appeal respectively, and submitted that it would be absurd to\ninterpret the sections and others as requiring the full complement of the Judges or Justices before such Courts could carry out their legal duties.\nOn the distinction between composition and quorum, he referred to Section 285 (1) of the Constitution (as amended) and Paragraph 1 (1) of the 6th schedule\nthereto to, which provides that the composition of the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunal and Governorship Election Tribunal shall consist of a\nChairman and two other members and Section 285 (4)\n106\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n119/179\nof the 1999 Constitution (First Alteration), which specifically provides for the quorum of the said Election Tribunals, which shall be the Chairman and one other\nmember. He maintained that while Sections 234, 247, 252, 263 and 268 of the Constitution make specific provisions for the quorum of the respective Courts,\nParagraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule contains no such provision. It is for this reason that he contends that recourse must be had to Section 28 of the Interpretation\nAct, which is authorised by Section 318 (4) of the Constitution. He submitted that by virtue of the said Section 28, the sitting of the Tribunal is valid if the Chairman\nsits with one other member. He submitted that the record shows that on 18/9/2015, the Chairman, Hon. Danladi Yakubu Umar sat with one other member, Hon. Agwadza\nW. Atedze and asserted that the said sitting was valid. He submitted that Paragraph 12 of the 3rd Schedule to the CCBT Act, which relates to the procedure for taking\nevidence at the trial, does not and cannot provide for the quorum of the Tribunal. He submitted further that Paragraph 12 of the 3rd Schedule to the CCBT\u00a0Act, which\nprovides rules of procedure for\n107\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n120/179\nthe tribunal, cannot override the provisions of Section 318 (4) and the 5th Schedule to the Constitution nor Section 28 of the Interpretation Act.\nThe main object of statutory interpretation is to discover the intention of the lawmaker, which is to be deduced from the language used. See: Buhari v. Yusuf (2003) 14\nNWLR (Pt. 841) 446 @ 535.\nThe golden rule of interpretation is that where the words used in the Constitution or in a statute are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their natural and\nordinary meaning unless to do so would lead to absurdity or inconsistency with the rest of the statute. Ibrahim v. Barde (1996) 9 NWLR (Pt.474) 513: Ojokolobo v.\nAlamu (1987) 3 NWLR (pt.61) 377 @ 402 F - H: Adisa v. Oyinwola & Ors. (2000) 6 SC (Pt.II) 47; Uwazurike & Ors. v. A.G. Federation (2007) 2 SC 169; Nigerian Army\nv. Aminu Kano\u00a0(2010)5 NWLR (Pt.1188) 429.\nIt is also trite that when interpreting the provisions of a statute, the Court must not ascribe meanings to clear, plain and unambiguous provisions in order to make such\nprovisions conform to the Court's view of their meaning or what they ought to be. See: A.G. Federation v. Guardian Newspapers Ltd. (1999) 9\n108\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n121/179\nNWLR (pt.618) 187 @ 264 G - H.\nThe Constitution is the supreme law of the land. It is the grundnorm i.e. it is the basic law from which all other laws of the society derive their validity. Section 1 (1) of\nthe 1999 Constitution (as amended) provides:\n1. (1) This Constitution is supreme and its provisions shall have binding force on all authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n(3) If any other law is inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution, this Constitution shall prevail, and that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency be\nvoid.\nSee: Abacha v. Fawehinmi (2000) 6 NWLR (pt.660) 228: P.D.P. v. C.P.C. (2011) 17 NWLR (Pt. 1277) 485.\nParagraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution is clear and unambiguous. It provides:\n\"15. (1) There shall be established a tribunal to be known as Code of Conduct Tribunal, which shall consist of a Chairman and two other persons.\"\nThe phrase \"consist of\" is defined in the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English, 8th Edition (International Student's Edition) page 310 as follows:\n\"Consist of: make up something;\n109\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n122/179\nconstitute; be comprised of;\nThese words all mean to be formed from the things or people mentioned, or to be the parts that form something.\"\nIf this definition is applied to Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule, it means the Chairman and two other members are the persons who make up the Tribunal. In other\nwords, the Code of Conduct established by the Constitution must be composed of the Chairman and two other members. This is the natural and ordinary meaning of\nthe words \"consist of\". The question is whether, as postulated by learned senior counsel for the appellant, the composition of the tribunal is the same as the quorum of\nmembers required to legally exercise its adjudicatory powers.\nOne of the ways of resolving this conundrum and ascertaining the intention of the lawmakers is to have a look at similar provisions in the Constitution, which provide for\nthe establishment of superior Courts of record and election tribunals.\nSections 230 and 237 of the 1999 Constitution provide as follows:\n\"Section 230\u00a0(1) There shall be a Supreme Court of Nigeria.\n(2) The Supreme Court of Nigeria shall consist of-\n(a) the Chief Justice of\n110\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n123/179\nNigeria; and\n(b) such number of Justices of the Supreme Court not exceeding twenty-one, as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly.\nSection 237\u00a0(1) There shall be a Court of Appeal.\n(2) The Court of Appeal shall consist of -\n(a) a President of the Court of Appeal; and\nb) such number of Justices of the Court of Appeal, not less than forty-nine, of which not less than three shall be learned in Islamic personal law, and not less than three\nshall be learned in Customary law, as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly.\"\nIt is apposite at this point to refer to the definition of \"quorum\" as contained in the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (infra) at page 1203. It is as follows:\n\"Quorum: the smallest number of people who must be at\na meeting before it can begin or decisions can be made.\"\nNow, if we were to apply the argument of learned senior counsel for the appellants to Sections 230 & 237 of the Constitution, there would be no need for any other\nprovision specifying the quorum necessary for each Court to carry out its judicial functions. That this is not the intention of the lawmakers\n111\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n124/179\nis borne out by Sections 234 and 247 of the Constitution, which provide as follows:\n\"Section 234.\nFor the purpose of exercising any jurisdiction conferred upon it by this Constitution or any law, the Supreme Court shall be duly constituted if it consists of not less\nthan five Justices of the Supreme Court;\nProvided that where the Supreme Court is sitting to consider an appeal brought under Section 232 (2) (b) or (c) of the Constitution, or to exercise its original\njurisdiction in accordance with Section 232 of this Constitution, the Court shall be constituted by seven justices.\nSection 247.\nFor the purpose of exercising any jurisdiction conferred upon it by this Constitution or any law, the Court of Appeal shall be duly constituted if it consists of not less\nthan three Justices of the Court of Appeal and in the case of appeals from -\n(a) a Sharia Court of Appeal, if it consists of not less than three Justices of the Court of Appeal learned in Islamic personal law; and\n(b) a Customary Court of Appeal, if it consists of not less than three Justices of the Court of Appeal learned in Customary law\"\n(Emphasis mine)\n112\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n125/179\nSee\u00a0also Sections 252, 254, 263 and 268 in respect of the Federal High Court, the National Industrial Court, the Sharia Court of Appeal of the Federal Capital Territory\n(FCT) and the Customary Court of Appeal of the FCT.\nIt is quite clear from the constitutional provisions set out and referred to above that the contention of learned senior counsel for the appellants that the framers of the\nConstitution use the word \"consist\" when they seek to determine the numerical strength of Judges or Justices necessary to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on the\nrespective Courts, is with respect, misconceived. What is consistent throughout the Constitution is that after providing for the composition of a Court or tribunal, the\nlawmakers made separate provision for the quorum of those Courts or tribunals. There is nowhere in the Constitution that quorum and composition are combined in\none provision.\nSection 285 (1) & (2) of the Constitution provides for the establishment of the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunals and the Governorship\nElection Tribunals. Subsection (3) provides that the composition of the said Tribunals shall be as set out\n113\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n126/179\nin the 6th Schedule to the Constitution. Paragraph A 1 (1) of the 6th Schedule provides that a National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunal shall consist of\na Chairman and two other members, while Paragraph B 2 (2) provides that a Governorship Election Tribunal shall consist of a Chairman and two other members.\nSubsection (4) of Section 285 goes on to provide that the quorum of an election Tribunal established under the section shall be the Chairman and one other member.\nThis provision buttresses the fact that even with respect to a tribunal established under the Constitution, separate provisions were made for its composition and\nquorum and that a quorum of two is not alien to the Constitution.\nFrom all that has been said above, it is evident that there is no express provision in Paragraph 15 of the 5th Schedule to the Constitution for the quorum of the Code\nof Conduct Tribunal. In a situation such as this, Section 318 (4) of the Constitution permits recourse to the Interpretation Act for guidance. Learned senior counsel for\nthe appellant has placed an interpretation on Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule, to wit: that it provides for both the\n114\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n127/179\ncomposition and the quorum of the Tribunal.\nThe Interpretation Act may be called in aid to determine whether the interpretation given accords with the intention of the lawmakers. The Interpretation Act is an Act\nof the National Assembly, which has been incorporated by reference, into the Constitution and is applicable to the 5th Schedule. Section 28 of the Interpretation Act\nprovides:\n\"28. Quorum\nNotwithstanding anything contained in any Act or other enactment the quorum of any tribunal, commission of enquiry (including an appeal tribunal established for the\npurpose of hearing any appeal arising therefrom) shall not be less than two (including the Chairman):\nProvided that the chairman and the member shall be present at every sitting of the tribunal, commission of\u00a0enquiry throughout the duration of the trial or hearing.\"\nAs rightly submitted by learned senior counsel for the respondent, relying on the case of: NDIC v. OKEM ENT. (2004) 10 NWLR (Pt.880) 107 @ 182, \"when the term\n\"notwithstanding\" is used in a statute it is meant to exclude an impinging or impeding effect of any other provision of the statute or other subordinate\n115\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n128/179\nlegislation so that the said section may fulfil itself.\" I therefore agree with him that Paragraph 12 of the 3rd Schedule to the CCBT Act, which provides for rules of\nprocedure for the tribunal, cannot override the provisions of Section 318 (4) of the Constitution, which, by reference, incorporated the provisions of Section 28 of the\nInterpretation Act.\nI am therefore in complete agreement with my learned brother in the lead judgment that the Tribunal was properly constituted on 18th September 2015 when it sat with\nthe Chairman and one other member. I resolve this issue against the appellant.\nThe second issue I wish to comment upon is Issue 3; whether having regard to the clear wording of Section 24 (2) of the CCBT Act, the 13-count charge preferred\nagainst the appellant by someone other than the Attorney-General of the Federation is competent:\nSection 24 (2) of the CCBT Act provides:\n\"24, (2) Prosecution for all offences under this Act shall be instituted in the name of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the Attorney-General of the Federation or such\nOfficers in the Federal Ministry of Justice as the Attorney-General of the Federation may\n116\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n129/179\nauthorise so to do.\"\nIt is the contention of learned senior counsel for the appellant that under Section 24 (2) of the CCBT Act, for a charge to be validly instituted before the Tribunal, it\nmust be filed in the name of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the Attorney-General himself or, if filed by any officer in the Federal Ministry of Justice, such officer\nmust have been specifically authorised by the Attorney-General of the Federation. He submitted that the specific provisions in Section 24 (2) of the CCBT Act and\nParagraph 18 of the 3rd Schedule to the Act take precedence over the general provisions of Sections 2 and 4 of the Law Officers Act Cap. L8 LFN 2004, relied upon\nby the two Lower Courts, which empowers the Solicitor General of the Federation to perform the duties of the Attorney-General in his absence and confers on him the\nsame powers as are imposed by\nlaw on the Attorney-General of the Federation. He relied on the maxim 'generalia specialibus non derogant: which was espoused by Karibi-Whyte, JSC in the case of:\nMatari v. Dangaladima (1993) 3 NWLR (PT. 281) 266. He also argued that the presumption of regularity of official acts is\n117\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n130/179\nrebutted in the instant case, as there is no evidence that the Solicitor-General personally exercised the powers of the Attorney-General or authorised any law officer in\nthe Federal Ministry of Justice to so act. He cited the case of: Abubakar v. Yar'Adua (2008) 19 NWLR (pt.1120) 1 @ 155.\nOn the other hand, learned senior counsel for the respondent argued that the Constitution is supreme and that any other law purporting to confer power to initiate\ncriminal proceedings must bow to the Constitution. He referred to Sections 174 and 211 of the Constitution and contended that the Constitution has covered the field\nin respect of the power to initiate criminal proceedings and is the authoritative law on the subject. He submitted that by the provisions of Section 174 and 211 of the\nConstitution, the Attorney-General of the Federation does not have exclusive power to initiate criminal proceedings, as law officers in the Ministry of Justice, lawyers\nin the employment of prosecuting agencies, policemen in the service of the Nigerian Police Force, among others also have the power to institute criminal proceedings.\nHe referred to: Comptroller of Prisons v.\n118\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n131/179\nAdekanye (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt.790) 318 @ 329 per Belgore, JSC (as he then was): FRN v. Osahon (2006) 5 NWLR (Pt.973) 361 @ 406 and FRN v. Adewunmi (2007)\n10 NWLR (pt. 1042) 399 @ 418-419. On the distinction between the office of the Attorney-General and the person occupying the office, he cited the case of: A.G.\nFederation v. ANPP (2003) 18 NWLR (pt.851) 182.\nAlternatively, he submitted\u00a0relying on Sections 2 and 4 of the Law Officers Act, 2004 and Section 168 (2) of the Evidence Act, 2011, that there is a presumption of\nregularity in favour of the competence of M.S. Hassan, Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Justice to initiate the charge against the appellant. He submitted that\nthe maxim \"generalia specialibus non derogant\" is inapplicable to the circumstances of this case, as the maxim only applies where the general and specific provisions\nare contained in the same statute and on the same subject matter. See: Jack v. Unam (2004) 5 NWLR (pt.865) 208 @ 229.\nIn considering this issue, I refer once more to Section 1(1) of the 1999 Constitution, which provides that the Constitution is supreme and that its provisions shall have\nbinding force on\n119\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n132/179\nall authorities and persons throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria. It is also worthy of note that the Attorney-General of the Federation is the only Minister of the\nFederal Republic whose powers are specifically provided for in the Constitution. Section 174 of the 1999 Constitution provides:\n\"174. (1) The Attorney-General of the Federation shall have power -\n(a) to institute and undertake criminal proceedings against any person before any Court of law in Nigeria, other than a Court-martial, in respect of any offence created\nby or under any Act of the National Assembly;\n(b) to take over and continue any such criminal proceedings that may have been instituted by any other authority or person; and\n(c) to discontinue at any stage before judgment is delivered any such criminal proceeding instituted or undertaken by him or any other authority or person.\n(2) The powers conferred upon the Attorney-General of the Federation under Subsection (1) of this Section may be exercised by him in person or through\nofficers of his department,\n(3) In exercising his powers under this Section, the Attorney-General of the Federation shall have\n120\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n133/179\nregard to the public interest, the interest of justice and the need to prevent the abuse of legal process.\"\n(Emphasis mine)\nSection 211 of the Constitution makes identical provisions for the office of the Attorney-General of a State in relation to offences created by or under any law of the\nHouse of Assembly. Section 174 (1) (b) & (c), which refers to proceedings initiated by \"any other authority or persons\", is a clear indication that the power of the\nAttorney-General to institute criminal proceedings is not exclusive to his office, Secondly, by Subsection (2) of Section 174 the powers conferred on the Attorney-\nGeneral may be exercised by him in person or through officers of his department. See: FRN v. Adewunmi (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt.1042) 399 @ 418 - 419. There is nothing\nin Section 174 that states that the Attorney-General must expressly delegate his powers to a law officer in his department.\nBy the provisions of Section 174 (2) of the Constitution, it is clear that the lawmakers appreciated the fact that there may be occasions when there is no incumbent\noccupant of the office of Attorney-General and necessary provisions must be in place to\n121\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n134/179\nensure that the business of the Ministry of Justice does not grind to a halt. Sections 2 and 4 of the Law Officers Act, 2004 also provide as follows:\n\"2. Creation of the offices of the law officers.\nThe offices of Attorney-General, Solicitor-General and State Counsel are hereby created.\n4. The Solicitor-General of the Federation in the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation may perform any of the duties and shall have the same powers as\nare Imposed by law on the Attorney-General of the Federation.\"\nIt is not in dispute that M.S. Hassan is a Deputy Director in the office of the Attorney-General. He informed the Tribunal that even though there was no sitting Attorney-\nGeneral, the Solicitor-General was in office and he was authorised to institute the proceedings. There is a presumption of regularity in his favour by virtue of Section\n168 of the Evidence Act. I fully agree with the majority decision of the Court below to the effect that the appellant failed to rebut the presumption of regularity in\nfavour of the initiation of the proceedings before the Tribunal by Mr. Hassan. It cannot be right, as asserted by learned senior counsel\n122\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n135/179\nfor the appellant that the burden of proving that he had the requisite authority was on Mr. Hassan. Indeed, as rightly observed by learned senior counsel for the\nrespondent, the only person who could challenge the authority of Mr. Hassan is the Solicitor-General of the Federation.\nIn its majority decision on this issue, the Court below per Adumein, JCA, held at pages 1252 - 1253 of the record:\n\"I do not agree with the contention of learned senior counsel for the appellant that consent to sign or institute prosecution must be physically delegated to the\nSolicitor General of the Federation or any other law officer of the Federation. This is so because Section 24 (2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act\ncannot be read in isolation of the clear provisions of Section 4 of the Law Officers Act. The right to perform the duties and exercise the powers of the Attorney-\nGeneral of the Federation by the Solicitor-General, in the absence of the former has statutory backing and to require physical consent is a requirement that is merely a\nsurplussage.\nThe Solicitor-General of the Federation, while performing the duties and exercising the powers of\n123\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n136/179\nthe Attorney-General of the Federation, in the absence of the latter, can do so through any law officer in the Federal Ministry of Justice. The law is that there is a\npresumption that 'any officer in any department of the Attorney-General's office is empowered to initiate criminal proceedings unless it is proved otherwise.... The\npresumption to initiate the prosecution in the Tribunal in favour of Mr. M.S. Hassan has not been rebutted by the appellant in this case.\"\nI find no reason to interfere with the sound reasoning above and fully endorse it. I therefore also resolve Issue 3 against the appellant.\nFor the reasons stated herein and for the more comprehensive reasons lucidly adumbrated in the leading judgment, I also find this appeal to be devoid of merit. I\nhereby dismiss it.\nCHIMA CENTUS NWEZE, J.S.C.: My Lord, Onnoghen, JSC, obliged me with the draft of the leading judgement just delivered now, I am persuaded by the ultimate\nconclusion judgement.\nAs\u00a0demonstrably\u00a0shown in my Lord's leading judgement, the agitations of the parties on the first issue have a far-reaching implication in our adversarial jurisprudence.\n124\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n137/179\nUnarguably, this first issue in the appellant's brief is framed in a rather woolly or imprecise manner.\nBe that at it may, his complaint here is\u00a0 actually\u00a0 woven around the question whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal (Lower Court, for short),\nrightly\u00a0construed the constitutional provisions apropos the proper Constitution of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (hereinafter, simply, referred to as \"the CCT\").\nArguments of counsel, having been\u00a0admirably\u00a0summed up in the leading judgement, this brief contribution shall resist the temptation of boring my Lords with their\nwearisome iteration.\nIt is not in doubt that the CCT sat with only the Chairman and one member. The question here is whether, in so doing, it [the CCT] was\u00a0properly\u00a0constituted.\nNow, the drafts person of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) (the Constitution, for short), deliberately, distinguishes between\nsuperior Courts of record and other Courts. The Courts under the former category (superior Courts) are\u00a0specifically\u00a0vested with the judicial powers of the Federation\nand of the States, Section 6 (1) and (2) of the\n125\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n138/179\nConstitution.\nIn addition, the Constitution\u00a0methodically\u00a0provides for the establishment of these Courts (see, for example, Section 230 (1) which establishes this Court) and the\nquorum for their exercise of jurisdiction. In the case of this Court, for the exercise of any jurisdiction conferred on it, it shall be, duly\u00a0constituted if it consists of not less\nthan five Justices in what may\u00a0loosely\u00a0be termed \"ordinary appeals,\" Section 234 of the Constitution.\nThe drafts person, specifically, resorted to this distinction in relation to, at least\u00a0one tribunal\u00a0namely, the Election Tribunal. Thus, while Paragraph 1 (1) of the Sixth\nSchedule provides for the composition of the National and State Houses of Assembly Election Tribunals, the First Alteration to the Constitution, [Section 285 (4)],\nexpressly, provides for the quorum of the said Election Tribunal to be \"the Chairman and one other member,\" AMPPP v. INEC (2015) LPELR - 25706 (SC).\nThe implication of this drafting technique is that where there is any defect as to the quorum of this Court, for example\u00a0or the said Election Tribunal, in the exercise of\nany jurisdiction so conferred, it\n126\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n139/179\ncannot exercise it (that jurisdiction) for the simple reason that a defect in competence is not intrinsic but\u00a0extrinsic to the process of adjudication, Goldmark Nigeria Ltd\nand Ors v. Ibafon Company Ltd [2012] 3 SC (pt 111) 72.\nIt cannot be otherwise for jurisdiction is the power of the Court to decide a matter in controversy and presupposes the existence of a duly constituted Court [as\nregards its quorum], with control over the subject matter and the parties, Egharevba v. Osadolar Eribo and Ors (2010) 3-5 SC (pt 111) 93. Above all, the jurisdiction of a\nCourt is given in a clear and express language and never to be looked for with a search light, Akinpelu v. Adegbore and Ors (2008) 4 -5 SC (pt 11) 75.\nHowever, quite apart from the above categories of Courts and other Courts which the States are empowered to establish pursuant to Section 6 (2) of the\nConstitution, certain categories of adjudicatory bodies were set up by the Constitution to tackle certain exigencies in our national life.\nParagraph 15 (1) of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution provides for the establishment of one of such adjudicatory bodies. Undoubtedly, the constitutional\n127\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n140/179\nprovisions (enshrined in the Fifth Schedule), dealing with the code of conduct for public officers, were primarily designed to enthrone probity in the public lives of\npublic officers (that is, officers listed in Part II of the Fifth Schedule) and, a fortiori, to promote transparency and accountability in governance.\nThe Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB, for short) and the CCT are the bodies responsible for effectuating the said code of conduct provisions. In particular, the latter [CCT]\nis the adjudicative arm in the entire architecture of the accountability provisions of the Third and Fifth Schedules of the Constitution. Its powers are outlined\nParagraph 18 of the Fifth Schedule.\nAs\u00a0 already\u00a0 shown above, there are express provisions with regard to the quorum of the conventional Courts (and, as shown above, the Election Tribunal) for the\nexercise of jurisdiction. This was not done with regard to the CCT, the Tribunal, specially\u00a0incorporated into the Constitution to deal with breaches of the Code of\nConduct provisions, that is, the provisions aimed at promoting accountability, probity, transparency in the lives of the public officers above.\n128\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n141/179\nThat\u00a0notwithstanding, the quorum of all categories of Tribunals (except, of course, the Tribunal contemplated in the First Alteration above, Section 285 (4) supra) is set\nout in an extant enactment which\u00a0 by Section 318 (4) of the Constitution, \"shall apply for the purposes of interpreting [its] provisions.\" That enactment is the\nInterpretation Act which\u00a0in Section 28, provides inter alia that \"... the quorum of any tribunal...shall not be less than two (including the Chairman).\"\nIn effect, Section 28 of the Interpretation Act can\u00a0always\u00a0be prayed in aid for the purpose of interpreting the constitutional provisions on the CCT apropos its quorum\nwhich is not\u00a0expressly\u00a0provided for in the organic law, the Constitution. In other words, the provisions should be construed harmoniously, Rabiu v. The State (1980) 8 - 11\nSC 130, 151, 195; Adesanya v. President of the Federal Republic and Anor (1981) 5 SC 112, 134, 321; Abegunde v. The Ondo House of Assembly and Ors [2015] 244 LRCN\n1, 374.\nThat done, it becomes evident that the quorum of the CCT \"shall not be less than two (members) (including the Chairman).\" As was held in Panama Refining Co v. Ryan\n293 US\n129\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n142/179\n388, 493 (1935), the meaning of a statute is to be looked for, not in any single section, but in all the parts together and in their relation to the end in view.\nIn the context of the CCT, the end in view (that is, the objective of the Constitution) is to have a functional tribunal which would achieve the purposes of the Fifth\nSchedule, that is, to meet the exigencies of accountability, probity, transparency in the lives of the said public officers. In my view, this is the only interpretation which\nwould guide this Court in discovering the intention of the Legislature on this point, Marwa and Anor v. Nyako and Ors [2012] 1 SCNJ 378.\nHere, I take the liberty to remind my Lords that one of the guiding posts in the interpretation of the provisions of the Nigerian Constitution is that the principles upon\nwhich it (the Constitution) was established, rather than the direct operation or literal meaning of the words used, measure the purpose and scope of its provisions,\nGlobal Excellence Communication Ltd v. Duke (2007) 16 NWLR (pt 1059) 22; AG, Bendel v. AG, Federation (1982) 3 NCLR 1.\nAbove all, the rationale of all binding authorities is that a\n130\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n143/179\nnarrow interpretation that would do violence to its provisions and fail to achieve the goal set by the Constitution must be avoided. Thus, where alternative\nconstructions are equally open, the construction that is consistent with the smooth working of the system, which the Constitution read as a whole has set out to\nregulate\u00a0is to be preferred, Dapianlong v. Dariye (2007) 8 NWLR (pt 1036) 239.\nThe principle that underlies this construction technique is that the Legislature would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result, IMB v. Tinubu\n(2001) 16 NWLR (Pt.740) 690; Tukur v. Government of Gongola State [1989] 4 NWLR (pt 117) 517, 579; Aqua Ltd v O. S. S. C. [1988] 4 NWLR (pt 91) 622; Ifezue v.\nMbadugha and Anor [1984] 15 NSCC 314; Nafiu Rabiu v. The State (1980) 8-9 SC 130.\nThis approach is consistent with the \"living tree\" doctrine of constitutional interpretation enunciated in Edward v. Canada [1932] AC 124 which postulates that the\nConstitution \"must be capable of growth to meet the future,\" N. K. Chakrabarti, Principles of Legislative and Legislative Drafting, (Third Edition) (Kolkata: R.\nCambray and Co. Private Ltd, 2011)\n131\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n144/179\n560, citing Graham,\u00a0\"Unified Theory of Statutory Interpretation,\" in Statute Law Review Vol 23, No 2, July, 2002 at 91 - 134.\nI, therefore, endorse the position that the construction of any document (and this includes the construction of the precious and organic document known as the 1999\nConstitution) is a holistic endeavour, United Sav. Ass'n of Tex v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs Ltd 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988) (per Scalia, J), see, generally, A. Scalia\nand G.

The Ondo State House of\nAssembly [2015] Vol. 244 LRCN 1, 374.\nIn my humble view, therefore\u00a0the plurality decision of the Lower Court was right in its conclusion that the said CCT was\u00a0properly\u00a0constituted (as regards its quorum)\nwhen it sat with the Chairman and one other member. I find no merit in the appellant's complaint here.\nIt is for these, and the more detailed\u00a0reasons in the leading judgment that I\u00a0too\u00a0hold the view that this appeal is unmeritorious, I abide by all the consequential orders in\nthe leading judgment.\n132\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n145/179\nAMIRU SANUSI, \u00a0 J.S.C.: This appeal is against the judgment of Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, (hereinafter referred to as \"the Court Below/Lower Court) delivered on\n30th October 2015. The said Judgment which was delivered by the Court below affirmed the decision of the Code of Conduct Tribunal (\"the trial Court or tribunal)\ndelivered on 18th of September 2015. The facts which have rise to this appeal are briefly put as below.\nThe appellant herein served for two terms as executive Government of Kwara State between May 2003 and May 2011. As a public servant, he filled four asset\ndeclaration forms covering the two periods he served as governor and submitted them to the Code of Conduct Bureau. Investigations were later made to verify the\ninformation about the assets he declared by the Code of Conduct Bureau and other agencies of the Federal Government and also as to how he acquired the assets\ndeclared by him. Upon conducting the investigation by the relevant authorities on the information given by the appellant in the four asset declaration forms he filled, it\nwas allegedly discovered that the appellant corruptly acquired some of the properties while he was serving as governor\n133\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n146/179\nof Kwara State which he did not declare in the asset declaration forms. It was also allegedly discovered that the appellant made ancipatory declaration of assets on\nassumption of office of governor which assets he later acquired. Another discovery made, was that the appellant sent some money outside Nigeria to purchase\nproperties in London and also that he maintained foreign bank accounts while serving as governor. All these allegations were regarded as infringement of Code of\nConduct Act by the appellant who is a public servant. Sequel to that, the Code of Conduct Bureau initiated criminal proceedings against the appellant before the Code\nof Conduct Tribunal sitting in Abuja, by filing criminal charges against him through the Federal Ministry of Justice. To that effect, a criminal summons was served on the\nappellant. As at the time the charges were framed against the appellant, there was no sitting Attorney General of the Federation, hence the charges framed against the\nappellant, were initiated or signed by one M.S. Hassan Esq. a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Justice with the consent of the Solicitor General of the said\nministry.\nUpon being\n134\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n147/179\nserved with criminal summons, the appellant herein\u00a0filed a motion on notice dated 17/9/2015 before the Code of Conduct Tribunal challenging the competence of the\ncharge No.CCI/ABJ/01/2015 framed against him and he at the same time, filed two suits before the Federal High Court, Abuja and Lagos challenging the validity of the\nproceedings initiated at the tribunal and he refused to appear before the Tribunal.\nHe also filed a Notice of Preliminary Objection earlier i.e. on 17/9/2015. When the matter came up before the tribunal for hearing on 18/9/2015, Chief J.B. Daudu, SAN of\nlearned senior counsel for the appellant drew the tribunal's attention to the Preliminary Objection he filed on 17/9/2015 and argued the objection. The preliminary\nObjection raised on behalf of the appellant was, inter alia, premised on the following grounds:-\n(a) That the charge(s) framed against the appellant was/were incompetent in view of the absence of sitting Attorney General of the Federation and for that reason, the\nappellant would not appear before the tribunal.\n(b) that the non-appearance of the appellant before the tribunal was because there was an existing order\n135\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n148/179\nof the Federal High Court on the tribunal to stop the proceedings.\nAfter taking argument on the Preliminary Objection, and upon considering the grounds of the preliminary objection, the tribunal delivered its considered ruling\noverruling the preliminary objection and dismissing same in that, it held that the charge(s) was/were properly instituted against the appellant. It also held that the\nproceedings was properly and competently instituted against the appellant. In the light of this stance, the tribunal held, it subsequently issued a bench warrant for the\narrest of the appellant and adjourned the matter to 19/9/2015 for the appellant to be arrested and brought before it to face the trial. The appellant did not appear on\n19/9/2015, hence the tribunal renewed or updated the bench warrant and further adjourned the case to 22/9/2015.\nWhen the case came up on 22/9/2015, the appellant appeared in Court even though there is no indication that the bench warrant was personally executed on him. On\nseeing that the appellant had appeared before it on 22/9/2015, the tribunal decided to revoke the bench warrant it had issued earlier, hence the charge(s) was/were\n136\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n149/179\non that day read to the appellant and his plea was taken. He was subsequently admitted to bail on his self cognizance and the trial/proceeding was adjourned till 22nd\nand 23rd October, 2015 for commencement of hearing in the case. Before the tribunal reconvened for the hearing of the case, the appellant appealed to the Court of\nAppeal (Court below) against the ruling of the tribunal dated 18/9/2015.\nAt the Court of Appeal, the appellant raised the following five issues, for determination, of his appeal, as listed below:-\n(1) Whether the Code of Conduct Tribunal was properly constituted when it sat with two members on 18/9/2015.\n(2) Whether the tribunal was competent to issue bench warrant when it is not a Court of criminal jurisdiction.\n(3) Whether the charge framed against the appellant was properly initiated when as at the time it was so framed or initiated, there was no sitting Attorney General of\nthe Federation (AGF) to do so.\n(4) That the issuance of criminal summons on the appellant for him to appear before the tribunal on 18/9/2015 was improper, and\n(5) That the Code of Conduct Tribunal wrongfully ignored the order of the\n137\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n150/179\nFederal High Court barring it from sitting.\nOn 10th October, 2015, the Court below heard the appeal of the appellant and adjourned same for judgment. Then on 10th October, 2015, it delivered its considered\njudgment by a simple\u00a0majority of two to one dismissing the appellant's appeal when it resolved four out of the five issues raised by the appellant as reproduced supra.\nIt is pertinent to say\u00a0that even the purported minority or dissenting judgment was only on issue No. 3 above i.e. the competence of Mr. M.S. Hassan Deputy Director,\nFederal Ministry of Justice to initiate the charge. It should also be noted that the Court below resolved issue No. 4 supra, in favour of the appellant when it reasoned\nthat the service of criminal summons on the appellant was defective because it was not really personally served on the appellant, but even then, it held that, that\nanomaly could not vitiate the charge and the plea taken from the appellant in view of the provisions of Section 136(a) of Administration of Criminal Justice Act of\n2015.\nThe appellant herein, became piqued by the judgment of the Court below delivered on 18th September, 2015, hence he further\n138\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n151/179\nappealed to this Court vide a notice of appeal which he filed on 2nd November 2015, containing seven grounds of appeal. In keeping with the rules and practice\napplicable in this Court, learned senior counsel to the parties filed and exchanged briefs of argument on behalf of their respective clients/parties.\nThe appellant's brief of argument, settled by his learned counsel Mr. J. B. Daudu SAN, was filed on 11th November 2015. Upon being served with the respondent's brief of\nargument, Mr. J. B. Daudu SAN, also filed Appellant's Reply Brief (settled by him) on the 25th November 2015. On the part of the respondent, its learned senior counsel\nMr. Rotimi Jacobs, SAN, filed the Respondent's Brief of Argument on 18th November 2015.\nBoth learned senior counsel adopted the briefs of argument they settled and filed on behalf of their respective parties.\nIn the appellant's brief of argument, six issues for determination were decoded from the seven grounds of appeal contained in the Notice of Appeal which said issues\nare set out below.\n\"(1) Whether the majority decision Court of Appeal Abuja Division was right in the interpretation of the Constitution when it held\n139\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n152/179\nthat the Code of Conduct tribunal was properly constituted in law when it sat on 18/10/2015 with just the\u00a0Chairman and one (1) other member in contravention of the\nprovisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule of the 1999 Constitution as to exercise the powers and jurisdiction vested by the 1999 Constitution and if the\nanswer is in the negative, whether the charge and the entire proceedings inclusive of the Ruling in issue is not null and void and of no consequence? (Grounds 1 and 2).\n(2) Whether the majority decision was right when it held that Code of Conduct Tribunal is a Court of limited criminal jurisdiction competent and empowered to issue a\nBench warrant against the appellant in the event of his absence from the proceedings of the Tribunal? (from Ground 3).\n(3) Having regard to the clear wording of Section 24(2) the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act Cap C15 2004 whether the 13 count charge preferred against\nthe Appellant by someone other than the Attorney General of the Federation is competent? (Ground 4).\n(4) Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal was correct in law, when it held that notwithstanding the lack\n140\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n153/179\nof proper service on the Appellant of the criminal summons to appear before the Code of Conduct Tribunal on the 18th of September, 2015, such a vice was a mere\nirregularity cured by the appearance of the Appellant at the proceedings regardless of the existence of Appellants' conditional appearance on protest. (Ground 5)\n(5) Whether the majority decision of the Court below was right when it justified the refusal of the Code of Conduct Tribunal to obey the Federal High Court to appear\nbefore it and show cause why it should not order a stay of further proceedings on the ground that the order in issue was not specifically asking the lower tribunal to\nstay its proceedings? (Ground 6).\n(6) Whether the majority decision of the Court of Appeal was correct when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal was a criminal Court empowered to apply the\nAdministration of Criminal Justice Act? (Ground 7).\"\nOn the other part, the learned senior counsel for the respondent raised five issues for the determination of this appeal, which are reproduced hereunder:-\nA. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right in its unanimous decision which held that the Code of\n141\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n154/179\nConduct Tribunal was properly constituted when it heard and determined the issues that culminated in the Tribunal's ruling of 18th September 2015 with the Chairman\nand one other member (Grounds 1 and 2).\nB. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that the Code of Conduct Tribunal though a Court of limited criminal jurisdiction, was competent to issue a\nbench warrant against the Appellant in the event of his failure to appear before it. (Ground 3)\nC. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right in its majority decision when it held that the charge preferred against the Appellant before the Code of Conduct Tribunal\nand signed by M.S. Hassan, a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Justice was competent notwithstanding that there was no sitting Attorney General of the\nFederation at the time it was initiated (Ground 4).\nD. Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that the issue of the alleged irregularity in the service of summons on the Appellant to appear before the\nCode of Conduct Tribunal on 18th September 2015 was not fatal to the proceedings before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (Grounds 5 and 7); and\n142\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n155/179\nE.\u00a0Whether the Court of Appeal was not right when it held that since the Federal High Court did not make any order on 17th September 2015 restraining the Code of\nConduct Tribunal from sitting, the issue of disobedience of that order or the superiority of the Federal High Court to the Tribunal would not arise (Ground 6).\u00a0\nThe issues formulated by the learned senior counsel for the respondent appears to me to be all encompassing as they captured all the six issues raised in the\nappellant's brief of argument. They are also less verbose and are more elegantly framed. I therefore chose to be guided by them in approaching this appeal and I shall\nonly consider those that are live issues and not sheer academic in nature.\nThe first issue for determination raised by the respondent corresponds with the first issue raised in the appellant's brief of argument and it has to do with the\nconstitutionality or otherwise of the sitting of the Code of Conduct Tribunal by sitting with Chairman and one member only. The learned senior counsel for the\nappellant in his submission faulted the Lower Court's interpretation of Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule to the\n143\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n156/179\nConstitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended (later to be simply referred to as \"the Constitution\") and its finding that Tribunal was\nproperly\u00a0constituted when it sat on 18/9/2015 with the Chairman and one member alone instead of two according to him. He argued that the constitutional provision is\nclear, plain, unambiguous and does not accommodate any doubt or ambiguity at all and therefore should have been given its natural and literal interpretation by the\nCourt below which however failed to do so. See Amasike v. Registrar General CAC (2006) 3 NWLR (pt. 968) 462); Ngige v. Obi (2006) 14 NWLR (pt 999). The learned\nsenior counsel submitted that the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of 5th Schedule to the Constitution is similar to the provisions of Section 20 (2) of Code of\nConduct Bureau and Tribunal Act Cap 23 LFN 2004, a domestic statute of the Tribunal which provides thus: \"The tribunal shall consist of a chairman and two other\nmember\". He argued that any composition less than that is fatal to the proper composition of the Tribunal.\nIn further submission, the learned silk for the Appellant argued that there was no any gap or lacuna created, to warrant resort to the Interpretation Act to find\n144\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n157/179\nthe quorum of the tribunal. Learned silk for the Appellant further submitted on this issue, that Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule to the Constitution provides for\nboth the \"composition\" and the \"quorum\" of the Tribunal since there must always be valid composition of the Tribunal before the question of quorum can arise. He said\nin this situation both 'Composition' and 'Quorum' are the same and the number is supposed to be three and not two. He argued that if the members sitting at the\ntribunal are below three, then it is not properly constituted and whatever decision it took or passed is unconstitutional, null and void. He argued that the provisions of\nParagraph 15 (1) of the 5th Schedule to the Constitution are plain, clear and unambiguous and must be given their 'lateral, ordinary and natural meaning\". He cited\nand relied on the cases of Amasike v. Registrar General Corporate Affairs Commission (2006) 3 NWLR (pt. 945) 465 and Ngige v. Obi (2006) 14 NWLR (pt. 999). He\nagain submitted that any short in the composition of the tribunal i.e. below three the (chairman inclusive) for any reason, affects the jurisdiction of the tribunal and\nviolates the\n145\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n158/179\nprovisions of Section 20(2) of Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act, Cap C23, LFN 2004, adding that there was not any lacunae left that requires to be filled, as\nwrongly held by the Court below would require any recourse to the Interpretation Act as done by the Court below. He contended that Paragraph 15 (1) of the 5th\nSchedule to the Constitution serves as the purpose of both the composition and quorum of the tribunal hence resort to the Interpretation Act is uncalled for and\nunnecessary as the provisions of Sections 27 and 28 of the Interpretation Act cannot sideline or curtail the constitutional provisions. Learned silk for the Appellant,\nfinally argued that to hold that two-man panel could form a quorum of the\nCode of Conduct tribunal in adjudication, tantamount to a\nbreach of the principles of fair hearing as enshrined in Section\u00a036 of the 1999 constitution as amended.\nIn his response to the appellant's senior counsel's submission supra, the learned senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the Court below was correct in its\ninterpretation and finding that the chairman and one member properly constitute or form the quorum of\n146\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n159/179\nthe Tribunal. He argued that the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule merely deals with establish of the Code of Conduct Tribunal because there is\ndifference\u00a0between \"consist of\" \"and\" \"quorum of\" as used by the legislature in that the provisions used the phrase \"consist of\" and NOT \"quorum of\".\u00a0Learned counsel\nproceeded to cite in his brief of argument, several provisions in the 1999 Constitution which used the Phrase \"consist of\". Notable among them are: Section 249 (2) of\nthe 1999 Constitution dealing with establishment of Federal High Court, Section 237 (2) of 1999 Constitution dealing with establishment of Court of Appeal; Section\n285(1) all of the 1999 Constitution as amended by Section 29 of the First Alteration dealing with establishment of National and State Houses of Assembly Election\ntribunal Section 285(3) of the same Constitution dealing with composition of Governorship Election Tribunal, and he further referred to or compared them with\nSection 285(4) of the same Constitution as amended which\u00a0specifically made provision for the quorum of the Election Tribunal very much unlike Paragraph 15(1) of\nthe 5th Schedule to the Constitution. Learned counsel then argued that since no mention of \"quorum\" was made in Paragraph 15(1), it\n147\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n160/179\nmeans the Constitution failed to adjudicate. It therefore had left a lacunae. Therefore argued the respondent's senior counsel, the Court below had rightly recourse to\nthe provisions of Section 28 of the Interpretation Act which provided that the quorum of a tribunal shall be the\u00a0chairman and a member which also includes the Code\nof Conduct Tribunal. He again stated that by the provision of Section 318(4) of the 1999 Constitution, the Interpretation Act could be used in interpreting the\nprovisions of the Constitution. He cited the case of Okoro v. Nigeria Army Council (2003) 3 NWLR (pt. 647) 77; State v. Olatunji (2003) 14 NWLR (pt. 889) 138; AG of\nFederation v. A-G of Anambra State (No 2) (2002) 6 NWLR (pt 764) 542 at 855.\nIt is noted by me, that the appellant's senior counsel filed an appellant reply brief on 25/11/2015. To me, that process is far\u00a0from\u00a0being or cannot in the true sense be\nregarded as or called a \"Reply brief\" because going through its contents, he only succeeded in amplifying, fine tuning or repeating the arguments he proffered in his\nmain brief. A reply brief should only address new issues raised in a respondent's brief which were earlier\n148\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n161/179\nnot canvassed or argue or to clarifying some grey areas raised in the respondent's brief but certainly NOT to emphasis, add, fine-tune or repeat what had earlier been\nargued in the appellant's brief. I shall therefore not bother to consider it here at all.\nParagraph 15 (1) of the 5th schedule reads thus:-\n\"There shall be established a tribunal to be known as Code of Conduct Tribunal which shall consist of a Chairman and two other persons\".\nI have set out the provisions of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the 1999 Constitution which is focal point or core point on which this issue resolves. It is a\ncardinal principle of interpretation that words should be given their literal, ordinary, natural meaning. Ngige vs. Obi (supra). The grouse of the appellant's senior counsel\nis that the Code of Conduct Tribunal was not properly constituted when it sat on the case of his client the appellant, since it sat with the chairman and one other\nmember only, instead of two other members. Obviously this complaint touches on issue of jurisdiction. It is trite law that before a Court can be said to be competent to\nadjudicate in a matter, it must satisfy the\n149\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n162/179\nfollowing features or conditions:-\n(a) It must be properly constituted with respect to the members and qualification of its members;\n(b) The subject matter of the action must be within its jurisdiction\n(c) The action is initiated by due process of law, and\n(d) Any condition precedent to the exercise if its jurisdiction must have been fulfilled. See Madukolu vs. Nkemdilim (1062) 1 ALL NLR 587, Dangana Anor v. Usman & 4 Or\n(2012) 2 SC (Pt.III) 103; NURT & Anor vs. RTGAN & 5 Ors (2012) 1 SC (Pt.11) 119.\nFrom the wordings of Paragraph 15(1) of 5th Schedule to the Constitution it is clearly stated\u00a0thus:-\n\"There shall be established a Tribunal to be known as the Code of Conduct Tribunal which shall consist of a chairman and two other \"person\".\nIt is discernable from the above, that the paragraph quoted supra simply made provisions for the establishment of the Tribunal by the appointing authority and it also\nwhen doing so, stated the member it will compose i.e. its composition \"which should be chairman and two other person. Anything short or more than such member\ncannot be said to be constitutional. The said provision in\n150\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n163/179\nmy view, is silent on how a quorum is formed when the tribunal is to adjudicate. The provision in my view, had left a lacunae or gap with regard to the number of\nmembers that could form a quorum for purpose of adjudication. This is very much unlike some provisions of the Constitution dealing with some Courts or tribunals,\nnotable among them, for instance, is Section 285 of the Constitution as amended which by Subsection (3) the composition of National and State Houses of Assembly\nand Governorship Election Tribunal were set out in 6th Schedule to the Constitution. But the said provisions went further to specifically provide the quorum of the\nElection tribunal vide its Subsection (4) when it stated thus:-\n\"The quorum of an election Tribunal established under this Section shall be Chairman and one other member\".\nFrom this Subsection, the legislators clearly meant that the section would provide the establishment and composition of the said Election tribunal and importantly, the\nnumber of members that could form a quorum. There are other provisions which provide for both the composition and the quorum specifically in the constitution such\nas Section 234,\n151\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n164/179\n247, 212, 263 and 268 of the Constitution as amended which deal with composition of some superior Courts of record established by the same Constitution. These\ntwo features are completely absent in the provision of Paragraph 15(1) of the 5th Schedule to the Constitution. I therefore do not share the view or sentiment of Mr.\nJ. B. Daudu SAN, for the Appellant, when he argued that the paragraph in question served dual purposes of providing for the both \"the composition\" and \"quorum\" at the\nsame time. For to accept that view, would\u00a0in my view, lead to over stretching the intention of the legislature, or to insert extraneous meaning or to import new addition\nover and above what the legislature had actually meant or had provided. If the legislature had wanted the said paragraph to include the two, it would have said so\nclearly as it did in some sections of the Constitution mentioned above.\nNow coming to the issue of \"Quorum\" of the Code of Conduct Tribunal, as I said earlier, Paragraph 15(1) did not make any provision on quorum. It merely provided for\nthe \"establishment\" and \"composition\" of the tribunal. Similarly, the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act\n152\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n165/179\ndid not specifically make provision on quorum either. In this situation, it is my view\u00a0that the Lower Court in this situation had no option but to seek resort to the\nprovisions of Interpretation Act as it had rightly done by invoking the provisions of Section 28 of Interpretation Act to determine the quorum of the tribunal which\nprovides thus:-\n\"Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act or any other enactment, the quorum of any tribunal, commission of enquiry (including any appeal tribunal established\nfor the purpose of hearing any appeal answering therefrom) shall not be less than two (including the chairman):-\nProvided that the Chairman and the member shall be present at every sitting of the tribunal, commission of enquiry throughout the duration of the trial or hearing.\"\nThus, from the wording of the above provisions, which is also applicable to the Code of Conduct Tribunal, the quorum of the tribunal is chairman and one other\nmember. The Court below is therefore correct in invoking the above provisions to determine the quorum of the tribunal since the Interpretation Act is always the law to\nresort to, in order to interpret the\n153\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n166/179\nprovisions of the Constitution or any other statute creating a statutory body. The provisions of Section 28 of the Interpretation Act has clearly and unequivocally\nprovided the answer as regards the quorum of the tribunal which is simply the Chairman and one member. Therefore, it is my view, that the tribunal was properly\nconstituted when the chairman and one member sat on the appellant's case 18/9/2015. I do not therefore see any reason to agree with the appellant's learned senior\ncounsel's view, that the right to fair hearing of the appellant was in anyway infringed. By Section 318 of the Constitution as amended, Interpretation Act can be\ninvoked. This first issue is therefore resolved against the appellant.\nThe second issue in the respondent's brief has to do with the competence of the tribunal to issue bench warrant against the appellant even though it has limited\ncriminal jurisdiction. To my mind, there is no need to dissipate energy in dealing with this issue, as I do not regard it as a live issue at all. To me, it is merely an academic\nissue which this Court lacks luxury of time to make any pronouncement on because whichever pronouncement is made\n154\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n167/179\non it, will serve little or no useful purpose to either of the two parties.\nThe learned appellant's senior counsel's stance is that the tribunal has no power to issue bench warrant because it has no criminal jurisdiction since it can not impose\nany punishment. I do not agree with the learned appellant's senior counsel on that submission, because Paragraph 1 to 11 of the 5th Schedule to the 1999\nConstitution, as amended, gave the tribunal powers to try persons who contravene the offences listed therein, especially offences bordering on bribery and corruption\nby public officers. This Court in the case of Ahmed vs. Ahmed (2013) 15 NWLR (Pt.1377) 274 stated as below:-\n\"If I may repeat, the Code of Conduct Tribunal has been established with exclusive jurisdiction to deal with all violations contravening any of the provisions of the Code\nas per Paragraph 15(1). This provision has expressly ousted the power of ordinary regular Courts in respect of such violation. The tribunal to the exclusion of other\nCourts is also empowered to impose any punishment as specified in or Subsection (2)(a)\u00a0(b) of Paragraph 18...\"\nFrom the above pronouncement by this\n155\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n168/179\nCourt, it clearly shows that the tribunal, at least\u00a0has quasi-criminal jurisdiction or limited jurisdiction as rightly held by the Lower Court. Having said so, I have no\nhesitation in holding that since it has criminal jurisdiction, it goes without saying, that it can as well competently issue bench warrant to arrest any person or accused\nperson charged before it, if such person/accused fails to appear before it as is the case of the present appellant in this instant case. To accept the submission of the\nlearned appellant's counsel that it has no power to issue such bench warrant, could mean opening flood gate for such suspects to refuse to appear before the tribunal\nand such situation will render the powers of Court or tribunal ineffective and it will ultimately stultify the administration of criminal justice. It needs to also be stressed\nhere, that the provisions of Paragraph 18(1) empowers the tribunal to make finding of guilt and to also impose punishment which to me, buttresses the point, that the\ntribunal has criminal jurisdiction. I therefore also resolve this second issue against the appellant.\nThe third issue for determination queries whether\n156\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n169/179\nthe Court below was correct when it held that the charge framed or preferred against the appellant by Mr. M. S. Hassan, Deputy Director Federal Ministry of Justice was\ncompetently preferred in the absence of a sitting Attorney General of the Federation. The contention of Mr. J. B. Daudu for the appellant, is of the view that since there\nwas no sitting Attorney General of the Federation as at the time Mr. M. S. Hassan, Deputy Director [MO] preferred the charges, the said charges were not competent. He\nhinged his contention on the provisions of Section 24(2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act which provides thus:-\n\"Section 24(2) of CCBT Act provides as below:\n\"Prosecution for all offence under this Act shall be instituted in the name of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the Attorney General of Federation, or such Officers in\nthe Federal Ministry of Justice as the Attorney General of the Federation may so to do\".\nTo the learned appellant's senior counsel, for a charge to be competently preferred by any officer of the ministry, such officer must be specifically authorized by the\nAttorney-General of the Federation. He argued also, that\n157\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n170/179\nthe provision of Section 24(2) of CCBT Act and Paragraph 18 of 3rd Schedule to the Act take precedent over the general provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of the Law\nOfficers Act, Cap 28, LFN 2004. He also cited Matari vs. Dam Galadima (1993) 3 NWLR (Pt.281) 266. The learned senior counsel submitted that the presumption of\nregularity of official act does not apply here, or is rebutted, since there is no evidence that the Solicitor-General had personally authorized any Law Officer to exercise\nsuch powers and he did not exercise it either or authorize M. S. Hassan to prefer the charges against the appellant. See Abubakar vs. YarAdua (2008) 19 NWLR (Pt.1120)\n1 at 55.\nIn his response, Mr. Rotimi Jacobs SAN for the Respondent contended that the Constitution has covered the field with regard to initiation of criminal proceedings, in\nview of its Section 174 and 211, which state that the power of the Attorney General to initiate proceedings is not exclusive because law officers in the Ministry of\nJustice, lawyers of some of Federal parastatals or agencies like Customs and Excise, Nigeria Police Force, can now initiate criminal proceedings. See Comptroller of\nPrisons v.\n158\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n171/179\nAdekanye (2002) 15 NWLR (Pt. 790) 318 (a) 329; FRN v. Osahon (2006) 5 NWLR (Pt. 973) 316 (a) 406; FRN v. Adewunmi (2007) 10 NWLR (Pt. 1042) 399 at 418/419. He\nalso submit that the presumption of regularity still applies to this instant case.\nI think in order to resolve this issue, it is apt to say that the provisions of Section 24(1) and (2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act 2004, Sections 2 and\n4 of that Act and Section 174 (1) and (2) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria of 1999 as amended, will have to come into play. I shall therefore\nreproduce them below:-\nSection 24(1) and (2) of the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal reads as below:-\n\"24(1) The Rules of procedure to be adopted in any prosecution for the offences under this Act, before the Tribunal and the forms to be used in such prosecution shall\nbe as set out in the Third Schedule to this Act.\n(2) Prosecution for all offences under this Act shall be instituted in the name of the Federal Republic of Nigeria by the Attorney-General of the Federation or such\nofficers in the Federal Ministry of Justice as the Attorney-General of the Federation\n159\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n172/179\nmay authorize so to do\".\nSection 174(1) and (2) of the 1999 Constitution as amended provides as below:-\n\"174(1) The Attorney-General of the Federation shall have powers:-\n(a) To institute and undertake Criminal Proceedings against any person before any Court of law in Nigeria other than Court Martial in respect of any offences directly or\nunder any Act of the National Assembly.\n(b) To take over and continue any such criminal proceedings that may have been instituted by any other authority or persons, and\n(c) To discontinue at any stage before judgment is delivered any such Criminal proceedings constituted by or undertaken by him or any other authority or person.\n(2) The powers conferred upon the Attorney-General of the Federation under Sub-section (1) of this Section may be exercised by him in person or through officers of\nhis Department\".\nNow first of all, from the wordings of Subsection 2 of Section 24 of the CCBT Act, it is clear and unambiguous that the Attorney-General of the Federation is the\nperson authorized to initiate proceedings before the Tribunal in person or by any of the officers in his ministry authorized by\n160\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n173/179\nhim to do so. Both parties are, ad idem, that as at the time Mr. M. S. Hassan a Deputy Director in the Federal Ministry of Justice initiated the proceedings against the\nappellant, there was really no sitting Attorney-General of the Federation. The question is, can Mr. M. S. Hassan competently prefer or initiate proceedings as he did\nagainst the appellant, when as at that time, there was no sitting Attorney-General? I think an answer to this question can be said to have been provided in the\nprovisions of Sections 2 and 4 of Law Officers Act 2004 and Section 174 of the Constitution, as amended which I have copiously reproduced above. Section 174\nSubsection (2) of the Constitution as amended is clear and unequivocal, in that it provides that even without a sitting Attorney-General of the Federation, an officer\nof his Department such as the Solicitor General can step into the shoes of the Attorney General to initiate or halt any proceeding in any Court trying an offence against\nany Act of the National Assembly. This section, to my mind, overrides Section 24(2) of CCBT Act since, being a constitutional provision, it certainly supercedes or\nover-rides any other\n161\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n174/179\nprovisions of any Act or Statute. See FRN v. Adewunmi (supra). Again it will be pertinent also to consider the provision of Section 2 and 4 of Law Officers Act Cap L8\nLFN which said provisions provide as follows:\n\"2 The office of the Attorney-General, solicitor General and State counsel are hereby created.\n4. The Solicitor General of the Federation in the absence of the Attorney-General of the Federation may perform any of the duties and shall have the same powers are\nimposed by law on the Attorney General of the Federation.\"\nThe clear and plain meaning of the above provisions is to the effect that even without a sitting Attorney General of the Federation, the Solicitor General steps into his\nshoes and could perform all the statutory functions of the Attorney General. The learned senior counsel for the appellant in my view wrongly laid his emphasis on the\nperson of the Attorney General rather than the office of the Attorney General. That is wrong, in my view. To say that without a sitting Attorney General in place, no\ncriminal proceedings can be initiated then the administration of justice will ground to a halt which will obviously be\n162\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n175/179\ninjurious and dangerous to the system of governance, especially if one considers the facts that an Attorney General of the Federation or State is the Chief Law officer\nof the Federation or of a the State. That contention of the learned silk for appellant if accepted could lead to chaos. In any case, regarding authorization, Mr. M. S.\nHassan had even disabused the mind of all stakeholders at the Tribunal, when he announced that be even had the mandate of his Solicitor General to initiate the said\nproceedings and the appellant did not dispute that or challenge him to produce such mandate, if he felt it was necessary so to do. This clearly further buttressed the\nissue of presumption of regularity. My stance on this third issue therefore is that Mr. M.S. Hassan has the competence and power to initiate the proceedings against the\nappellant at the Tribunal. I therefore resolve this third issue against the appellant.\nFinally, I do not want to delve much on the fourth and fifth issues for determination which relate to the regularity or otherwise of Court summons issued on the\nappellant by the Tribunal and the alleged order of Federal High Court on the Code of\n163\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n176/179\nConduct Tribunal to stop proceedings respectively. With regard to the issuance or service of civil summons served on the appellant, I regard that as a spent issue,\nsince the majority decision of the Court below was that the summons was not personally served on the appellant and in fact, the Tribunal having secured the\nattendance or appearance of the appellant, it decided to cancel that process. Also the Court below even regarded the civil summons as defective. As regards the order\nof the Federal High Court allegedly disobeyed by the Tribunal, it is my view that, that issue is spent and my stance on the last two issues supra renders it academic.\nThere is therefore no need to expend energy in making any pronouncement here on those issues for determination as they will be of little or no benefit to any of the\nparties to this appeal since they are no longer live issues. In addition, even if it is considered here, it will as I said above, only serve academic purpose and Courts should\nalways avoid embarking on, since the Court has no luxury time to do so.\nOn the whole, in the light of these few comments of mine and the more detailed reasons ably and\n164\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n177/179\npainstakingly advance in the lead judgment of my learned brother Onnoghen JSC, which I entirely agree with, I also do not see any merit in this appeal. I dismiss it and\naffirm the judgment of the Court below delivered on 30/10/2015 which had also dismissed the appellant's appeal against the Ruling of the Code of Conduct Tribunal.\nAppeal is hereby dismissed for want to merit.\n165\n5/8/25, 11:06 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n178/179\nJ.

These include: (i) That the court shall hear both sides\nnot only in the case but also in all material issues in the case before reaching a decision which may be prejudicial to any party in the case. See Sheldon v.\nBromfield Justices (1964) 2 Q.B. 573, at p. 578. (ii) That the court or tribunal shall give equal treatment, opportunity, and consideration to all concerned. See\non this: Adigun v. Attorney General,Oyo State and Ors. (1987) 1 N. W. L. R. (Pt.53) 678. ( iii)that the proceedings shall be held in public and all concerned shall\nhave access to and be informed of such a place of public hearing and (iv)That the proceedings shall be held in public and all concerned shall have access\nto and be informed of such a place of public hearing and that having regard to all the circumstances, in every material decision in the case, justice must not\nonly be done but must manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to have been done: R. v. Sussex Justices, ex parte McCarthy (1924) 1 K.B. 256, at p.259; Deduwa\nand Ors. v. Okorodudu (1976) 10 SC. 329. Thus, fair hearing in the context of Section 33(1) of the Constitution of 1979 encompasses the plenitude of natural\njustice in the narrow technical sense of the twin pillars of justice - audi alteram partem and nemo judex in causa sua as well as in the broad sense of what is\nnot only right and fair to all concerned but also seems to be so.\"\nEQUITABLE REMEDY - INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTIONS - Purport and necessity of undertaking as to damages in an application for\ninterlocutory injunction\n\"In the case of Graham v. Campbell (supra) James L.J. stated at page 496: The undertaking as to damages which ought to be given on every interlocutory\ninjunction is one on which (unless under special circumstances) effect ought to be given.\"\nACTION - CLAIM(S)/RELIEF(S) - Whether the Court can grant a relief not claimed\n\"It is a fundamental principle for the administration of justice in civil cases, that the court is limited and circumscribed in what it can grant or the awards it\ncan make by the claim of the Plaintiff. He is not entitled to be awarded more. In Ekpenyong &amp; Ors. v. Inyang Nyong &amp; Ors. (1975) 2 S.C. 71, 80, this\nCourt declared: \"The Court is without power to award to claimant that which he did not claim. We take the view that this proposition of the law is not only\ngood law but good sense. A court of law may award less, and not more than what the parties have claimed or pleaded by either party.\" See also Ochonma v.\nUnosi (1965) N.M.L.R. 321.''\nEQUITABLE REMEDY - INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTIONS - Distinction between interlocutory/interim injunction\n\"It is useful to examine the meaning and scope of the words \"interlocutory\" and \"interim\" which have been used very freely and often times regarded as\ninterchangeable in applications for injunctions. See Kufeji v. Kogbe (1961) 1 All N.L.R. 113; Iroegbu v. Ugbo (1970-71) 1 E.C.S.L.R. 162. An interlocutory application\nis an application which can be made in the course of a proceeding, and at any stage of a cause or matter, for the purpose of keeping the parties in status\nquo till the determination of the action - See Obeya Memorial Specialist Hospital v. Attorney-General for the Federation (1987) 3 N.W.L.R. (Pt. 60) 325.\nOjukwu v. Governor of Lagos State (1986) 3 N. W. L. R. (Pt. 26) 39. The word \"interim\" used also in applications and orders of injunction for maintaining the\nstatus quo of parties to a suit means \"temporary\", \"in the mean time.\" However an injunction described as interim falls within the above definition and is an\ninterlocutory injunction because it is an application made in the course of the proceedings. But unlike an interlocutory injunction properly so called, an\ninterim injunction is not one granted till the determination of the suit. It is an injunction made until a named date or until further order or until an application\non notice can be heard. Thus they bear all the features and trappings of an interlocutory injunction and granted upon the same consideration of equity.\nInterim orders for injunction can be made pending motion on notice of an interlocutory injunction where applicant is able to show that irretrievable damage\nmay be done before the completion of the hearing of the interlocutory application. See Beese v. Woodhouse (1970) 1 W.L.R. 586, 590. An interim injunction\nis intended to be temporary in its character and any person at whose suit such an injunction is obtained is under an obligation to limit, so far as possible,\nthe time during which it is operative. See Port Way Press Ltd. v. Hague (1957) R.P.C. 426 at p. 429.\"\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/102\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - EX PARTE APPLICATION - Rationale for ex-parte injunction\n\"The rationale for an ex parte application is the prevention of imminent irretrievable injury or damage to the right of one of the parties to the suit. Urgency is\nthe necessary fulcrum on which the application rests. However, the basis of granting the application is also the existence of special circumstances and the\nurgency to protect the destruction of the right involved in the suit. Thus in the absence of a real urgency, the rationale for an ex parte application cannot be\njustified.\"\nEQUITABLE REMEDY - INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTIONS - Purport and necessity of undertaking as to damages in an application for\ninterlocutory injunction\n\"It is settled that an undertaking to pay damages is the price which the person asking for an interlocutory injunction has to pay, and it ought to be required\non every interlocutory order. See Chappel v. Davidson 44 E.R. 289; Graham v. Campbell (1877-1878) 7 Ch. D. 490 C.A., Smith v. Day (1882) 21 Ch. D. 421 C.A.;\nBaxter v. Claydon (1952) W.N., 376, Tucker v. New Brunswick Trading Co. of London (1890) 44 Ch. D. 249. The undertaking to pay damages applies whether\nthe plaintiff has not been guilty of misrepresentation, suppression or other default in obtaining the injunction. Griffith v. Blake (1884) 27 Ch. D. 474 C.A.\ndissenting from contrary dictum of Jessel M.R. in Smith v. Day (supra). The undertaking is equally enforceable whether the mistake in granting the injunction\nwas on a point of law or fact. Hunt v. Hunt (1884) 54 LJ. Ch. 289 (again contrary to the dictum of Jessel M.R. in Smith v. Day.\"\nJUDGEMENT SUMMARY\nINTRODUCTION:\nThis appeal borders on on Civil procedure.\nFACTS:\nThis is an appeal against the decisions of the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos and the Court of Appeal.\nBy a letter dated the 14th April, 1987, to the Societe Generale Bank, the Central Bank ordered certain steps to be taken and nullified certain decisions reached by the Bank\n(Societe Generale). The said letter affected both the interests of the Bank as well as some of its directors which include that of the Plaintiff. \u00a0On the 22nd of April, 1987, the\nPlaintiff filed an action in the Federal High Court, Lagos, against the Central Bank, the Attorney-General of the Federation, and he Societe Generale Bank (Nig.) Ltd challenging\nthe directive contained in the letter of the 14th April, 1987. On the same day, that is, 22nd April, 1987, the Plaintiff filed a motion ex parte praying for an restrictive and injuctive\nreliefs which includes; \u00a0restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants, their servants and/or agents from in any way obstructing or frustrating the holding of the Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank until the final determination of this suit, \u00a0 and until the determination of the matter, the defendants be restrained from appointing or\nrecognizing the appointment of any person or persons as Directors of the 3rd Defendant Company other than such of them as are or may be duly appointed in accordance with\nthe provisions of the Articles of Association of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\u00a0\nNo motion on notice was filed to the same effect. On the same 22nd April, 1987, the Federal High Court granted all the Reliefs sought in the application and more. The\n1st defendant/respondent Central Bank of Nigeria, and the 4th to 8th defendants/respondents, who later joined the suit, appealed against the Ruling on the exparte\napplication to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and set aside the orders. The Plaintiff thereupon appealed to the Supreme Court against\nthe decision of the Court of Appeal. The 4th-8th respondents also Cross-appealed attacking the order made by the Court of Appeal remitting the case back for\ncontinuation before another Judge contending that since the exparte motion had been declared void, continuation before another Judge was unnecessary.\nISSUES:\nThe issues distilled by the Supreme Court for determination of the appeal are as follows;\n\"(1) Regardless of the wording of the Rules of Court, should the learned trial Judge have entertained the Appellant's application for an ex-parte interlocutory injunction\nmore so in the\u00a0particular instance when no case of real urgency was shown nor was it impossible to give notice of the motion to the Respondents.\n(2) Assuming (but without conceding that) that the learned trial Chief Judge could take the application, should he have made the various orders made on the said\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n4/102\napplication.\n(3) Should an undertaking as to damages not have been taken from the Appellant and what is the effect of a failure so to do.\"\nDECISION/HELD:\nIn the final analysis, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and allowed the cross-appeal.\nPHILIP NNAEMEKA-AGU, J.S.C. (Delivering the\nLeading Judgment).: This appeal involves a\nquestion which has raised some serious furor in\nrecent times, to wit: The question of ex parte\norders of injunction. It touches an area of law\nwhich, in spite of numerous appellate decisions,\nappears to have been quite often misunderstood\nand misapplied by some courts of trial. Recent\ninstances show that there is an urgent need to\nstate the law.\nThe facts leading to the appeal are important for a\nfull appreciation of the legal problems involved.\nCertain allegations of mismanagement by the third\nDefendant, Societe General Bank (Nigeria) Limited,\ncame to the notice of the Central Bank of Nigeria.\nAfter investigating the allegations and taking\ninstructions from the Federal Ministry of Finance,\nthe Central Bank issued to the Chairman of the\nBank, Mr. N.

Representation and Procedure for appointing\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n7/102\nDirectors on the Board of the Bank:\nThat the government accepted our observations\nthat the issue of appointing new directors revolves\naround control which cannot be divorced from the\n10\nissue of ownership and that once the ownership\ndispute is resolved, it would provide an acceptable\nsolution to how much control both parties could\nhave in running the affairs of the bank.\nSimilarly, the government is in agreement with\nthe proposal contained in paragraph four of the Nigerian\nEnterprises Promotion Board's letter reference CT\n.3422/Vol.1/233 of 27th October, 1986 addressed\nto the Managing Director (Photostat copy attached).\nIn consequence, you are strictly directed to\nincorporate into the Memorandum and Articles of\nAssociation of the bank all agreed understanding\nbetween the two partners (Nigerian/French) which\nformed the basis of your application for banking\nlicense and upon which the banking license was\nissued. You are also required to incorporate in the\nMemorandum and Articles of Association\nappropriately the Management Agreement on page\nnine of the feasibility report which is the basis\nagreed upon between the partners of the method of\nnomination of Directors of the Board of the bank\nwhich now must be followed in the reconstitution of\nthe new Board and should be ratified soon after the\nnew Board has been properly constituted.\nFurthermore, the government accepted our\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/102\nrecommendation that some of the Articles of\nAssociation of the bank would need to be\nre-examined for suitable amendment by the new\nBoard. For example, Article 104 dealing with the\nquorum of the Board may create problem of\ninterpretation, as it can be interpreted to mean two\nrepresentatives of the French Foreign Partners on\n11\nthe Board to the exclusion of Nigerians or vice\nversa.\nSimilarly, Article 64(i) regarding the quorum of\nthe general meeting can also give room for\nexcluding either one of the partners yet a valid\nquorum could be formed. In order to avoid future\nconflicts, government has directed that such\nArticles of Association be amended appropriately\nwithin two months of the inception of the new\nBoard and the Ministry notified accordingly through\nthe Central Bank of Nigeria.\nPursuant to the foregoing a fresh Board should\ntherefore, be constituted now and be fully\nfunctional within four weeks of receipt of this letter\nand inform us immediately for onward transmission\nto the Ministry. Accordingly, the Nigerian and\nforeign partner should each make its nomination to\nthe Board at once.\nPlease note that under no circumstance should any\nof those on the former board which has been\nfragmented be re-appointed to serve on the new\nBoard. This is to say that those who have served or\nare presently serving on the Board should not be\nre-appointed to serve on the new Board to be\nconstituted.\nAccordingly, the Government directs that the\nNigerian Shareholders should meet as a group\nurgently without delay to nominate the Nigerian\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/102\nrepresentatives to serve on the Board. The list of\nthe nominees should reach us not later than 10\ndays from the date of this letter, failing which the\nGovernment will be compelled to take appropriate\n12\naction in accordance with the provisions of the\nBanking Decree 1969.\nSimilarly, the French Partners should forward to us\nthe list of their nominees to reach us within the\nsame time frame.\nThese directives of government are aimed at\nensuring that the normal operations of the bank\nare uninterrupted.\n3. Accumulation of Bad debts and Nonpayment of\nCash Dividends.\nOur Special Investigation revealed that facilities\nobtained from the bank by directors/shareholders\nwere either poorly serviced or never serviced as\nshown in Appendix II of this letter Most of the\nfacilities were either not secured at all or not\nadequately secured contrary to the provisions of\nSection 13(i)(c) of the Banking Act, 1969. These\nirregularities and other weaknesses in the Credit\nAdministration Machinery of the bank constitute an\nindictment on the competence and integrity of the\nBoard and Management of the bank.\nFurthermore,\nthe special investigation revealed a phenomenal\nincrease in the classified bad and doubtful debts\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n10/102\nfrom about N24.2 million to about N149.2 million\nbetween our 1982 and 1986 examination reports of\nwhich 10% were facilities extended to Dr. Saraki\nand companies introduced by him.\nThe case with which most of the facilities now\nclassified as bad and doubtful debts were obtained\ndid not reflect the level of expert in Credit\nAdministration, one would expect from the French\nTechnical Partner which is largely responsible for\n13\nthe day to day management of the bank.\nAs regards the issue of non-payment of cash\ndividends, the expectation of Dr. Saraki is\nunrealistic in view of the sharp rise in the\naccumulated bad debts. The payment of cash\ndividend by a bank whose capital had been\ninadequate could not be regarded as prudent, as\nearnings from which cash dividends could be paid\nshould be seen as a \"return on capital\" rather than\nas \"return of capital.\"\nThe Federal Ministry of\u00a0Finance viewed the foregoing observations made by\u00a0the Central Bank with grave concern and in view of\u00a0the ineptitude in the conduct and\nadministration of\u00a0the Board and Management team, the government\nhas directed that they be reciprocally dealt with.\nAccordingly, by the powers conferred on the\nHonorable Minister of Finance under Section 22 and\nSub-section (a) (ii) of this Section of the Banking\nDecree 1969, the government directs that the\nmanagement team for the bank be replaced as a\nmatter of urgency within 3-6 months of the\ninception of the new Board so as to enhance the\nsmooth running of the bank under the new Board.\nIn this regard, the new board should ensure that\nmonthly returns of the gradual phasing out of the\npresent management team is made to us for\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n11/102\nonward transmission to the Federal Ministry of\nFinance.\nAs regards the overdue loans and advances, the\ngovernment accepts the recommendation of the\nCentral Bank and directs that the new Board when\nappointed, should cause all delinquent borrowers to\n14\nsubmit realistic and acceptable repayment\nproposals to it while the debt collection machinery\nshould be overhauled to ensure effective collection\nof past due debts.\n4. Persistent Violation of Government Regulations\nand Advice\nThe Special Investigation Report revealed series of\ncontraventions of the provisions of the Banking Act\n1969 and violations of government regulations and\nadvice particularly with regard to (1) capital\nholding structure by Nigerians, (2) the\nmanagement agreement which up to the time of\nour investigation had not been registered with the\nNational Office of Industrial Property (NOIP) as\nrequired by Section 5(i) of the National Office of\nIndustrial Property Act 1979 and (3) the holding of\nthe Board Meeting of 28th October, 1986. The\nnon-observance or deliberate violation of laid down\nregulations by the Monetary Authorities and other\nregulatory agencies such as NEPB and SEC will not\nserve the best interest of the bank.\nAccordingly, the government warns the Board and\nManagement that failure to comply with given\nfinancial regulations and government advice will in\nfuture fetch your bank serious consequences\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/102\nincluding the suspension of your bank's dealership\nlicense.\nAs regards the foreign exchange fraud involving\nN397, 450 perpetrated in November, 1984, the\ngovernment accepts our recommendation that the\nbank be allowed to implement its decision to pay\nthis amount to its customer - (Mr. K. B. Omatseye)\n15\nunder the new dispensation of SFEM and\naccordingly directed that the settlement be effected\nwithin three weeks of receipt of this letter.\n5. Nigerianisation:\nThe Special Investigation report revealed that while\nthe management of the bank's branches with very\nlimited authority was in the hands of Nigerians,\nHead Office Operations in the areas of General\nManagement, Inspection, Treasury, Computer\nOperations, Organization and Method (O&M),\nCommercial lending and the post of Chief Executive\nwere in the hands of the expatriates. The\ngovernment agreed with our observation that\nunless necessary adjustment is effected in the\nallocation of responsibility between the expatriate\nand Nigerian officers, the control of the bank would\nhardly be diminished by the projected expatriate\nstaff of six (6) in 1990.\nAccordingly, the government directs that succession\nplan be reviewed immediately with a view to\nenabling Nigerians to be actively involved in the\naffairs of the bank. The new Board, when\nappointed, is expected to note this directive of\ngovernment for strict adherence and should submit\nsituation report every six months to the Central\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/102\nBank on the progress made to Nigerianise the\nidentified posts for onward transmission to the\nFederal Ministry of Finance.\nPlease, note the urgent need to implement the\ngovernment directives without resorting to\nacrimony and/or confrontation with the authorities.\nIt is in the best interest of your bank and the entire\n16\nbanking system that the directive, and\nrecommendations contained herein are complied\nwith strictly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yours sincerely,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 A.

Dated this 22nd Day of April, 1987.\"\nThe 4th to 8th Respondents were joined after the\norder, the subject of this appeal.\nOn the same day, the appellant filed a motion ex\nparte under Order 20 of the Federal High Court\nRules, 1976, for an order:\n\"(i) Restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants their\nservants and/or agents from in any way obstructing\nor frustrating the holding of the Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank until the final\ndetermination of this suit;\n(ii) For an order of injunction that until the\ndetermination of this suit the Defendants be\nrestrained from appointing or recognizing the\nappointment of any person or persons as Directors\nof the 3rd Defendant company other than such of\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/102\nthem as are or may be duly appointed in\naccordance with the provisions of the Articles of\nAssociation of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\"\nThe application was supported by an affidavit and an\naffidavit of urgency.

That I am the plaintiff herein.\n2. That I am the Chairman of the Board of Directors\nof the 3rd Defendant Bank.\n3. That Notice summoning the Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank for the 25th of\nApril, 1987 was issued on the 26th of March, 1987.\n4. That on the morning of Thursday the 16th of\nApril, 1987 I returned home a little after 12 noon\nand was shown a letter addressed to me by the 1st\nDefendant herein directing that the Nigerian\nDirectors of the 3rd Defendant Bank to meet\nurgently and to select its representatives on the\nBoard of the Bank and forward a list thereof to the\n1st Defendant within 10 days of the letter. The said\nletter is dated the 14th of April, 1987 and a copy of\nthe same is already exhibited to the Affidavit in\nsupport of the Motion filed herein.\n5. That the 1st Defendant has threatened in its\naforesaid letter that if the list of new Directors is\nnot supplied to it within 10 days of the said letter it\nwould take appropriate measures against the 3rd\nDefendant under the Banking Act.\n6. That I have therefore commenced these\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/102\nproceedings seeking a number of declarations and\ninjunctive relief.\n7. That I have also filed an ex parte Motion for\ninterim injunction and it is of crucial importance\nthat this application for interim injunction be heard\nimmediately in view of the fact that the Annual\nGeneral Meeting of the bank is due to be held at\n20\nthe end of this week and the time limit within\nwhich the 1st Defendant has demanded a list of\nDirectors will expire on the 24th April, 1987.\n8. That I therefore pray that this application be\nheard as a matter of urgency. \"No motion on notice\nwas filed to the same effect.\nThe ex parte motion was heard the same day by\nAnyaegbunam, C.J. He then proceeded to make the\nfollowing orders:\n(i) That 1st and 2nd Defendants/Respondents, their\nservants and agents should not in any way obstruct\nor frustrate the holding of the Annual General\nMeeting of 3rd Defendant/Respondent Bank\nwhenever it is fixed.\n(ii) That when the said Annual General Meeting is\nheld the ordinary affairs of the 3rd\nDefendant/Respondent Bank should be discussed.\n(iii) That no new Directors will be appointed, the\nold Directors should continue to function until the\ndetermination of this Application or the Court\notherwise orders.\n(iv) I hereby also order that 1st, 2nd and 3rd\nDefendants/Respondents be served with all the\nmotion papers. This will enable them file whatever\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/102\npapers they wish to. Adjourned Application to\nMonday, 27/4/87 at 1 p.m.\"\nBy a Notice of Appeal\ndated the 5th day of May, 1987, the 1st\nRespondent herein appealed. After hearing the\nappeal, the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division allowed\nthe appeal. In the lead judgment of Awogu, J.C.A.,\nto which Akpata and Kalgo, JJ.C.A., concurred, he\nheld inter alia, as follows:\n21\n(i) That what the learned C. J. made was in the\nnature of an immediate absolute order, not an\ninterim order; and not one appropriate under the\nrule it was purported to have been brought;\n(ii) That the order made by the learned C. J.\namounted to a final order, without hearing the\nRespondents;\n(iii) That the trial court granted to the applicant\nmore than what he asked for;\n(iv) That although an affidavit of urgency was\nfiled no case of urgency was made out to warrant\nan ex parte hearing; and that although he was\nallowing the appeal on other grounds, he would\nadditionally have done so for failure of the\napplicant to give an undertaking as to damages.\nThe applicant, hereinafter called the appellant, has\nappealed to this court. All the Defendants including\nthose who were joined after the order was made,\nshall be called the Respondents.\nSo much confusion and conflict appear to have\nsurrounded the use of the expressions \"ex parte\",\n\"interim\", and \"interlocutory\" in the briefs of\ncounsel that I deem it necessary to begin by\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/102\nexamining these terms. Indeed, even in decided\ncases this lack of agreement as to the precise\nmeanings of these words is pretty obvious. At times\nthey are used as if \"interlocutory\" and \"interim\"\nwere interchangeable.\nIn Kufeji v Kogbe 1 All N.L.R. 113, at p. 114, an\napplication for an injunction which was fully argued\nand deliberated upon and in every way had all the\nattributes of an interlocutory injunction was\n22\nreferred to as interim injunction. In fact \"interim\"\nand \"interlocutory\" were freely used as if they were\ninterchangeable. See also I. U. Iroegbu v. Mark A.\nUgbo (1970-71) 1 E. C. S. L. R.162.\nI think it is correct to say that \"ex parte\" in relation\nto injunctions is properly used in contradistinction\nto \"on notice\" - and both expressions, which are\nmutually exclusive, more strictly rather refer to the\nmanner in which the application is brought and the\norder procured. An applicant for a non injunction\nmay bring the application ex parte, that is without\nnotice to the other side or with notice to the other\nside, is appropriate. By their very nature\ninjunctions granted on ex parte applications can\nonly be properly interim in nature. They are made,\nwithout notice to the other side, to keep matters in\nstatus quo to a named date, usually not more than\na few days, or until the Respondent can be put on\nnotice. The rationale of an order made on such an\napplication is that delay to be caused by proceeding\nin the ordinary way by putting the other side on\nnotice would or might cause such an irretrievable\nor serious mischief. Such injunctions are for cases\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/102\nof real urgency. The emphasis is on \"real.\"\nWhat is contemplated by the law is urgency between the\nhappening of the event which is sought to be\nrestrained by injunction and the date the\napplication could be heard if taken after due notice\nto the other side. So, if an incident which forms the\nbasis of an application occurred long enough for the\napplicant to have given due notice of the\napplication to the other side if he had acted\n23\npromptly but he delays so much in bringing the\napplication until there is not enough time to put the\nother side on notice, then there is a case of\nself-induced urgency, and not one of real urgency\nwithin the meaning of the law. This self-induced\nurgency will not warrant the granting of the\napplication ex parte.\nMegarry, J., as he then was, put the principle\nrather succinctly in the case of Bates v. Lord\nHailsham of Marylebone (1972) 3 ALL E.R. 1019, at\np. 1025, where he stated:\n\"An injunction is a serious matter, and must be\ntreated seriously. If there is a plaintiff who has\nknown about a proposal for ten weeks in general\nterms and for nearly four weeks in detail, and he\nwants an injunction to prevent effect being given to\nit at a meeting of which he has known for well over\na fortnight, he must have a most cogent\nexplanation if he is to obtain his injunction on an\nex parte application made two and a half hours\nbefore the meeting is due to begin. It is no answer\nto say, as counsel for the plaintiff sought to say,\nthat the grant of an injunction will do the\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n21/102\nDefendants no harm, for apart from other\nconsiderations, an inference from an insufficiently\nexplained tardiness in the application is that the\nurgency and the gravity of the plaintiff's case are\nless ,than compelling. Ex parte injunctions are for\ncases of real urgency, where there has been a true\nimpossibility of giving notice of motion.''\nOn the other hand, even though the word\ninterlocutory comes from two Latin words \"inter\"\n24\n(meaning between or among) and \"locutus\"\n(meaning spoken) and strictly means an injunction\ngranted after due contest inter partes, yet when\nused in contradistinction to \"interim\" in relation to\ninjunctions, it means an injunction not only ordered\nafter a full contest between the parties but also\nordered to last \"until the determination of the main\nsuit.\" Applications for interlocutory injunctions are\nproperly made on notice to the other side to keep\nmatters in status quo until the determination of the\nsuit. Evidence is by affidavit. On the hearing of the\napplication for an interlocutory injunction, the\ncourt, after avoiding all controversial issues of fact,\nhas to decide a number of important issues,\nincluding:\n(i) the strength of the applicant's case. A long time\nago, the plaintiff was required to show a strong\nprima facie case that he was entitled to relief (see\nHarman Pictures N. V. v. Osborne (1967) 1 W.L.R.\n723). However since the decision of the House of\nLords in American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd.\n(1975) A.C. 396, at pp. 407-409 it has been held\nthat what the applicant needs to show is only a real\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/102\npossibility, not a probability, of success at the trial-\nthat there is a serious question to be tried. This is\nnow an accepted principle in this country.\nSee Obeya Memorial Specialist Hospital v. Attorney\nGeneral of the Federation and Anor. (1987)3 N. W.\nL. R. (Pt.60) 325, at p.340. It does appear, too,\nfrom the decision in Cory v. Reindeer S.S. Co.\n(1915) 31 T.L.R. 530 that once the plaintiff\nsatisfies this requisite standard in this respect, the\n25\norder will still be made even though the Defendant\nhas a technical defence.\n(ii) Once the applicant gets over the initial hurdle\nof showing that there is a serious question to be\ntried, he must succeed in showing that the balance\nof convenience is on his side, that is that more\njustice will result in granting the application than in\nrefusing it. The onus of proving that the balance of\nconvenience is on his side is that of the applicant:\nSee Missini and Ors. v. Balogun (1968) 1 All N.L.R.\n318.\n(iii) The applicant, to succeed, even if he has shown\nthat he has a good case and that the balance of\nconvenience is on his side must furthermore show\nthat damages cannot be an adequate compensation\nfor his damage, if he succeeds at the end of the\nday.\n(iv) Conduct of the parties has also, quite often,\nbeen a relevant factor in the consideration of\nwhether or not to grant an application for\ninterlocutory injunction, as with permanent\ninjunction. For an example, a plaintiff who is also in\nsubstantial breach of contract cannot himself get an\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/102\norder of interlocutory injunction against a\nDefendant alleged to be in breach. See on this\nJ ackson v. Hamlyin (1953) 1 W.L.R. 713.\nAlso delay in bringing the application will defeat it\nbecause such a delay postulates that there is no\nurgency in the matter and destroys the very basis\nfor a prompt relief by way of interlocutory\ninjunction.\nIt can be seen from the nature of the above issues\n26\nthat they are such that they cannot, and ought not,\nbe decided without hearing both sides to the\ncontest.\nInterim injunctions, on the other hand, while often\nshowing the trammels of orders of injunction made\nex parte are not necessarily coterminous with\nthem. Their main feature which distinguishes them\nfrom interlocutory injunctions is that they are made\nto preserve the status quo until a named date or\nuntil further order or until an application on notice\ncan be heard. They are also for cases of real\nurgency. But, unlike ex parte orders for injunction,\nthey can be made during the hearing of a motion\non notice for interlocutory injunction when,\nbecause of the length of the hearing, it is shown\nthat an irretrievable mischief or damage may be\noccasioned before the completion of hearing. Also it\ncan be made to avoid such an irretrievable mischief\nor damage when due to the pressure of business of\nthe court or through no fault of the applicant it is\nimpossible to hear and determine the application on\nnotice for interlocutory injunction. See Beese v.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/102\nWoodhouse (1970) 1 W.L.R. 586, at p. 590. It\nmust, however, be emphasized that what the court\ndoes in such a case is not to hear the application\nfor interlocutory injunction ex parte, behind the\nback of the respondent, but to make an order which\nhas the effect of preserving the status quo until the\napplication for interlocutory injunction can be heard\nand determined. This is the way I see the dicta of\nGriffith, C.J. in Thomas Edison Ltd. v. Bullock\n(1912) 15 C.L.R. 679, at p. 681 which Chief\n27\nWilliams has cited in argument. The learned C.J.\nsaid:\n\"There is a primary precept governing the\nadministration of justice, that no man is to be\ncondemned unheard; and therefore, as a general\nrule, no order should be made to the prejudice of a\nparty unless he has the opportunity of being heard\nin defence. But instances occur where justice could\nnot be done unless the subject matter of the suit\nwere preserved, and, if that is in danger of\ndestruction by one party, or if irremediable or\nserious damage be imminent, the other may come\nto the court, and ask for its interposition even in\nthe absence of his opponent, on the ground that\ndelay would involve greater injustice than instant\naction.\"\nI entirely agree with him. But there is\nnothing in the above dicta or in the case itself to\nwarrant the hearing of an interlocutory application\nfor injunction ex parte. Indeed this court sounded\nmuch the same caveat, per Ibekwe, J.S.C. (as he\nthen was) when he stated in Woluchem v. Wokoma\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/102\n(1974) 1 All N.L.R. (Part 1) 605, at p. 607.\n\"An interlocutory injunction has a binding effect\nuntil it is discharged. Failure to comply with it could\nlead to disastrous consequences, such as having to\ncommit the offending party to prison for contempt.\nIt is a well settled rule of practice in civil\nproceedings that the party to be affected by the\norder sought should normally be put on notice.\"\nSee on the above: Daniel's Chancery Practice (7th\nEdn.) pp. 1363-1364, Snell's Principles of Equity\n(28th Edn.) pp. 639-644 and 646; vol. 24 Hals.\n28\nLaws of Eng. para. 1052. In my opinion it is in\nthese senses that the expressions \"ex parte\",\n\"interim\" and \"interlocutory\" should be used. It is\nfrom the above principles that I shall now consider\nthe arguments which have been urged on us in this\nappeal.\nChief G.O.K. Ajayi S.A.N., while conceding it that\nan application for an injunction \"until the final\ndetermination of the suit\" is one for an\ninterlocutory injunction, submitted that by the joint\neffect of Section 13 of the Federal High Court Act,\n1973, Order 33 (particularly rules 5, 8, and 10) of\nthe Federal High Court Rules, 1976, and Order 20\n(particularly rules 4 and 5) of the same, a party\ncan apply for an interlocutory injunction ex parte.\nHe went further to submit that a court can make\nsuch an order ex parte and that the rules provide\nthat any person affected by an order made ex parte\nis entitled to apply for its review. He relied on the\ncase of WEA Records Ltd. v. Visions Channel 4 Ltd.\n(1983) 1 W.L.R. 721.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/102\nProfessor Kasunmu, S.A.N., while not disputing it\nthat the rules provide that such an application can\nbe made ex parte, submitted that once it is one\n\"until the final determination of the suit,\" it is one\nfor interlocutory injunction which ought not be\nheard or granted ex parte. He urged the court to\napprove the decision of the Court of Appeal to that\neffect in a number of decisions, including - F.C.A./L\n/5/81: University of Lagos & Anor. v. Olaniyan of 8\nFebruary, 1981.Ojukwu v. Governor of Lagos &\nAnor . (1986) 3 N.W.L.R. (part 26) 39, at p. 44.\n29\nOn his part, M. O. Adio, the Director of Civil\nLitigation Federal Ministry of Justice, for the 2nd\nRespondent, made submissions. He submitted that\nwhat the appellant applied for was an order of\ninterlocutory injunction and that he was wrong in\nlaw, to have applied for it ex parte. What he should\nhave applied for was an interim order. He, however\nsubmitted that the learned Chief Judge was right to\nhave entertained it and for cutting the application\nto size in the way he made subsequent five\norders.''\nChief Olowofoyeku for the 3rd\u00a0Respondent filed a brief in which he attacked the\u00a0decision of the Court of Appeal and urged that the\u00a0appeal should be allowed. Chief\nWilliams objected\u00a0to the whole brief on the ground that, as counsel\nfor a Respondent, not having cross-appealed or\nfiled a Respondent's notice, he was not competent\nto argue as he did. We came to the conclusion that\nthe objection was well-taken. This court has said a\nnumber of times that what is open to a Respondent\nin the position of the 3rd Respondent is either to\ncross-appeal or file a Respondent's notice as the\ncase may be: See Oguma Associated Companies\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/102\n(Nig.) Ltd. v. I.B.W.A. Ltd. (1988) 1 N.W.L.R.\n(Pt.73) 658, at p. 681; Eliochin (Nig.) Ltd. v.\nMbadiwe (1986) 1 N.W.L.R. (part 14) 47 . So, the\nbrief was struck out. We did not hear counsel in\noral argument.\nChief F.R.A. Williams, S.A.N., submitted that the\nCourt of Appeal was right to have held that both\nprayers were for interlocutory injunction in so far\nas the application was \"until the final determination\n30\nof the suit.\" He submitted that the learned Chief\nJudge ought not to have entertained the application\nat all. In this country, he submitted, we must read\nwhatever Section 13 of the Federal High Court Act\nand Orders 20 and 33 say with the provision of\nSection 33(1) of the Constitution in view. He\npointed out that Or.33 r. 10 gives three options to a\ncourt before whom such an application comes: but\nthose options must be exercised with the\nconstitutional provision in view.\nI wish to begin my consideration of this aspect of\nthis appeal by pointing out that there is really no\ndispute that an application for injunction \"until the\nfinal determination of the suit\" is an application for\nan interlocutory, and not an interim order. The real\nissue is as to whether such an application can be\nheard and granted ex parte. I have examined\nabove the nature of a decision in an interlocutory\ninjunction and shown that it entails a deliberation\non a number of well-settled issues upon which the\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/102\nright of an applicant to the grant of it depends. The\nquestion, therefore, is, in view of the provisions of\nSection 33 of the Constitution of 1979, can and\nshould a court proceed to deliberate on those issues\nand come to conclusions on them on an ex parte\nhearing, that is without hearing all the parties to be\naffected by the order?\nTo answer this question\u00a0properly, it is necessary to consider the provision\u00a0under Section 33 of the Constitution of 1979,\nparticularly sub-section (1)\n. This provides as follows:\n\"(1) In the determination of his civil rights and\n31\nobligations, including any question or\ndetermination by or against any government or\nauthority, a person shall be entitled to a fair\nhearing within a reasonable time by a court or\nother tribunal established by law and constituted in\nsuch manner as to secure its independence and\nimpartiality.''\nClearly whenever the need arises for\nthe determination of the civil rights and obligations\nof every Nigerian, this provision guarantees to such\na person a fair hearing within a reasonable time.\nFair hearing has been interpreted by the courts to\nbe synonymous with fair trial and as implying that\nevery reasonable and fair minded observer who\nwatches the proceedings should be able to come to\nthe conclusion that the court or other tribunal has\nbeen fair to all the parties concerned.

It must\nalways be borne in mind when we consider English\ndecisions on the point that in Nigeria, the right of\nfair hearing is a right entrenched in the\nConstitution whereas in England it is a creation of\nthe common law which is regulated by the Rules.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/102\nThe effect of entrenching a provision in the\nConstitution is that it overrides all contrary\nprovisions in any law of the land, be they\nsubstantive or adjectival. As it is so, Chief Williams\nand Professor Kasunmu were right when they\nsubmitted that Orders 20 and 33 of the Federal\nHigh Court rules must be interpreted and applied in\nsuch a way as not to run counter to the letters and\nspirit of Section 33 of the Constitution. In so far as\nthis was the attitude of the Court of Appeal in their\ndecisions which have been referred to in argument\nand which they applied in this case, that Court has\n34\nbeen right in the matter. I therefore wish to\nemphasize that although Order XXXIII rule 10 of\nthe Federal High Court Rules, which is by the way\ngeneral to all interlocutory applications and not\nlimited to applications for injunctions, provides for\nthree alternative orders by the Court, namely:\n(i) Refusing to make the order;\n(ii) Granting the order to show cause why the order\nshould not be made; or\n(iii) Allowing the order to be made on notice,\nThere is nothing in the rule to empower the court\nto grant the application ex parte. An order to show\ncause implies a postponement of the hearing and\nbringing the opposite party to court for him to be\nheard before the order is made. Although rule 7\nsays that a motion may be brought ex parte or on\nnotice, motions for interlocutory injunctions ought\nnot to be expressed to be ex parte.\nBefore I consider the nature of the order made by\nthe learned Chief Judge I would like to express an\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/102\nopinion on the submission of Mr. Adio that the 1st\nRespondent, as the appellant in the Court of\nAppeal, should have applied to the learned Chief\nJudge to set aside the order rather than appealing\nagainst it. When it is noted that Mr. Adio is counsel\nto the 2nd Respondent in this appeal, as well as in\nthe court below, one wonders what procedure he\nhas adopted. As a Respondent's counsel, unless he\ncross-appealed or filed a Respondent's notice, his\ntraditional role ought to be to defend the judgment\nappealed against. If he wanted to depart from this\nrole, he was obliged to cross-appeal or file a\n35\nRespondent's notice.\nMaybe, the other counsel for the Respondent did\nnot object to that part of his brief because, in the\nend, he came to the conclusion that the appeal\nshould be dismissed. Be that as it may, I must state\nit clearly that without taking these necessary steps,\na Respondent's counsel has not got the power to\nfreely criticize the judgment of the court he is\nsupposed to defend.\nHowever, considering the point for what it is worth,\nI would allow myself to be guided by the\nConstitution. Now under Sections 219, 220, and 221\nof the Constitution of 1979, a party is empowered\nto appeal, as of right or by leave to the Court of\nAppeal, as the case may be, against decisions of a\nHigh Court, Federal or State. The word \"decision\" is\ndefined in Section 277 of the same Constitution as\nmeaning:\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n33/102\n\"in relation to a court any determination of that\ncourt and includes judgment, decree, order,\nconviction, sentence or recommendation'' of the\ncourt. It is, therefore, wide enough to include the\ntype of order appealed against in this case. It\nfollows, therefore, that by the very letter of the\nConstitution which is not only the supreme law of\nthe land but also, in appropriate metaphor, the\ntouchstone and yard-stick of measurement of the\nvalidity of all other laws, it is intended that such\ndecisions should be appeal able. As it is so, all rules\nof court which run counter to or are inconsistent\nwith this enabling provision of the Constitution are,\nipso facto, null and void to the extent of the\n36\ninconsistency. Much as there could be occasions\nwhen a person affected may wish to invoke the\nprovisions of Order XXXIII rule II of the Federal\nHigh Court (Civil Procedure) Rules and apply to\ndischarge or vary an ex parte interim order\nobtained against him, such an application should\nnever arise in the case of an order of interlocutory\ninjunction, for the simple reason that it ought\nnever be made ex parte, in this country at least.\nThis is because, as I have shown, an order of\ninterlocutory injunction is predicated on the\ndetermination of a number of contentious issues\nwhich would require that the court hears both sides\nbefore deciding. Moreover, in my judgment to give\na person the right to apply to set aside an order\nafter it has been made can never be an equal right\nwith hearing him before the order is made. For, in\nthe former case, the onus is on him to satisfy the\ncourt that the order, already made, ought to be\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n34/102\ndischarged or varied. And he has the onerous\nburden of displacing the presumption that a\njudgment or order of court is correct. In the latter\ncase, he has at least as much an opportunity as his\nadversary of showing why the order should not be\nmade. He can also bring before the court materials\nwhich could support his stand. If, after the court\nhas considered all the materials brought, and\nargument advanced, by both sides the odds are\nevenly weighted or in favour of the Respondent,\nthe order will not be made: for the onus at that\nstage is on the applicant to satisfy the court. These\nare the reasons why it is recognized by high\n37\nauthority that, ex post facto hearing is inferior to\nhearing before decision. See De. Smith : Judicial\nReview of Administrative Action (4th Edn.) p. 193.\nAs this is so, the right to apply to vary or discharge\nan order of interlocutory injunction made ex parte\nlacks one of the attributes of fair hearing which I\nhave enunciated above, to wit: equality of\nopportunity to both sides to the contest. It,\ntherefore, falls short of the expectations of Section\n33(1) of the 1979 Constitution. This is why in this\ncountry an application to set aside an order made\nex parte should arise only in the case of interim\norders which should not cause serious detriment to\nthe person affected and where there is a case of\nreal urgency and it is impracticable to afford an\nantecedent hearing.\nA good deal of argument was advanced by counsel\non different sides as to the nature of the procedure\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n35/102\nadopted by the learned Chief Judge in determining\nthe application before him. Chief Ajayi, while\nconceding as I have stated, that there was only one\napplication ex parte and that by the nature of the\napplication, it was an interlocutory order, submitted\nthat all that the learned Chief Judge did was to\nmake an interim order on it on the 22nd of April,\n1987 and then adjourn it to the 27th for hearing\nwhen the Respondents were to be heard. Mr. Adio\nsupported him somehow by stating that the learned\nChief Judge rightly made as much order as was\nnecessary on the 22nd of April and adjourned the\nhearing. Professor Kasunmu and Chief Williams, on\nthe other hand, pointed out that there was only\n38\none motion, and that was the motion ex parte; that\nthe first two orders made were in the nature of\nabsolute orders which granted to the appellant all\nthat he prayed for in the application; and that the\nother orders were ancillary. Chief Williams also\nsubmitted that even if it is assumed that the 4th\norder which adjourned the application (after it had\nbeen decided) to the 27th of April converted it into\nan interim order - a point he would not concede -\nthe order for hearing on the 27th April when the\nmeeting was fixed on the 25th was a spent order,\nwhich offends against Section 33 of the\nConstitution.\nMy first regret in this aspect of the arguments is\nthat procedure in, and order of, court on a matter\nwith set procedure should be allowed to drift into\nquibbling uncertainty by reason of a mere\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n36/102\nwhimsical deviation from settled practice. For it is\nsettled that a person who seeks an interim order ex\nparte while also applying for an interlocutory\ninjunction files two motions, simultaneously, one ex\nparte asking for the interim order, and the other on\nnotice applying for an interlocutory injunction. The\ncourt before whom the applications come takes the\nex parte motion and, if satisfied that it has merit ex\nfacie, grants it making the order to the date when\nthe motion on notice shall be heard. Parties and\ntheir counsel ought not to be encouraged to file and\nargue a sole application ex parte when asking for\norders which can only be properly made on notice.\nIn the instant case, there is force in the arguments\nof Chief Williams and Professor Kasunmu that the\n39\nfirst two orders made were in the nature of\nabsolute orders, granting to the appellant his main\nprayers in the ex parte application set out above\nwithout the other side being given a hearing. In\npoint of fact, he also decided some of the issues\nraised in the letter of directive of the Central Bank\nbeing contested in the writ and the statement of\nclaim. Having granted them, there was nothing left\nto be heard on the 27th of April. It is immaterial\nthat an order was made about service of papers on\nthem. The Respondents, without being heard in\nopposition, had been restrained from preventing\nthe holding of the general meeting of the 3rd\nRespondents scheduled to take place on the 25th of\nApril. I do not see how it could ever be doubted\nthat they were entitled to be heard on this point\nbefore the order was made. I did not, in my opinion\nconsider the type of analysis which Chief Ajayi went\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n37/102\ninto in this case relevant. He tried to show that the\nmain question was the appointment of directors.\nNor did I consider whether or not the order as\nmade was more beneficial to the appellant or the\nRespondents. In my judgment the over-riding\nquestion is whether in the orders relating to\nrestraining the holding of the general meeting as\nwell as touching on the appointment of directors,\nthe Respondents were, in the court of trial, entitled\nto be heard before the application was heard and\nthe order made. Once I come to the conclusion that\nthey should as I feel bound to do, it is no longer\nnecessary to go into an analysis of the order made\nto find out whether or not it is beneficial to the\n40\napplicant or whether it should have been granted if\na hearing was had. For the rule of fair hearing is\nnot a technical doctrine. It is one of substance. The\nquestion is not whether injustice had been done\nbecause of lack of hearing. It is whether a party\nentitled to be heard before deciding had in fact\nbeen given the opportunity of a hearing. Once an\nappellate court comes to the conclusion that the\nparty was entitled to be heard before a decision\nwas reached but was not given the opportunity of a\nhearing, the order or judgment thus entered is\nbound to be set aside. This is because such an\norder is against the rule of fair hearing, one of the\ntwin pillars of natural justice which is expressed by\nthe maxim: audi alteram partem. It is note-worthy\nthat Chief Ajayi conceded in his brief that \"the\neffect of the two interim orders made by\nAnyaegbunam, C.J. was not only to prevent the 1st\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n38/102\nand 2nd Defendants from preventing the holding of\nthe Annual General Meeting but also to place a\nrestriction on the plaintiff from proceeding to\nappoint new Directors . . .\"\nThe Court of Appeal was\u00a0therefore right to hold that the order for service of\u00a0unspecified papers on the respondents which the\u00a0learned Chief Judge made after making\nthe orders\nex parte was tantamount to shutting the stable\nafter the animal had bolted away. In such matters\nthe court proceeds on general principles.\nBlackburn, J., expressed this general principle over\none century ago in these words in the case of R. v.\nRand (1866) L.R. 1 Q.B. 834, at p. 836:\n\"It is not only of some importance, but is of\n41\nfundamental importance that justice should not\nonly be done, but should manifestly and\nundoubtedly be seen to be done.\" See also Lord\nHewart, C.J., in R. v. Sussex J.J., ex parte McCarthy\n(1924) 1 K.B. 256, at p. 259. Having heard the\napplication ex parte and made the far reaching\norders which I have set out above, I do not see\nwhat hearing was left to be done on the 27th of\nApril. The decision in WEA Records Ltd. v. Visions\nChannel 4 Ltd. (1983) 1 W.L.R. 721 relied upon by\nChief Ajayi is inapplicable in so far as it decided\nthat orders for interlocutory injunctions can be\nmade ex parte and served on the Respondent with\nhis liberty to apply to set it aside.\nThe learned Senior Advocate for the appellant\nfurther attacked the opinion of the Court of Appeal\nthat even if they were orders which the learned\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n39/102\nC.J. could have made on the ex parte application,\nthere was no case of real urgency established and\nso the application should have been dismissed on\nthat ground. He pointed out that there was an\naffidavit of urgency filed and that the only\nnecessary value of such an affidavit was to help the\nlearned Chief Judge to decide whether or not to\ntake the application on grounds or urgency: once\nthe court, upon a view of the affidavit of urgency,\ndecided to take the application, the affidavit of\nurgency was spent. So, as this was a matter within\nhis discretion, once he so decided his decision\ncannot be set aside on appeal. He conceded it,\nhowever, that decided cases show that ex parte\ninjunctions are made on cases of real urgency, but\n42\nwent ahead to submit that what the learned Judge\ndid was not to decide the application but to direct\nthat the other side be put on notice.\nWith respect, I believe that the learned Senior\nAdvocate for the appellant has missed the point. To\nstart with, as I have stated, the C.J. decided the\napplication. Also the basis of granting any ex parte\norder of injunction, particularly in view of Section\n33(1) of the Constitution of 1979, is the existence\nof special circumstances, invariably, all-pervading\nreal urgency, which requires that the order must be\nmade, otherwise an irretrievable harm or injury\nwould be occasioned to the prejudice of the\napplicant. Put in another way, if the matter is not\nshown to be urgent, there is no reason why ex\nparte order should be made at all: the existence of\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n40/102\nreal urgency, and not self-imposed urgency, is a\nsine qua non for a proper ex parte order of\ninjunction. On the contents of the affidavit of\nurgency set out above, I agree with the learned\nJustices of the Court of Appeal that no case of real\nurgency or any other exceptional circumstances\nwas made out. What was shown was self-imposed\nurgency caused by the applicant's culpable delay in\nbringing the application. This was not enough.\nThe learned Senior Advocate for the appellant has\nalso further argued that the Court of Appeal was\nwrong to have held that even if the ex parte order\nof injunction made by the learned Chief Judge was\nto set aside on other grounds, it would have been\nset aside for the failure of the appellant to give an\nundertaking as to damages. He submitted that\n43\nwhere an appellate court comes to the conclusion\nthat such an undertaking was necessary but had\nnot been given, it is no proper ground to set aside\nthe order. The proper order to make was one\ndirecting the applicant to give the undertaking. In\nsupport, he cited the following cases:\nSmith v. Day (1882) 22 Ch. D. at p. 424\nGraham v. Campbell (1877-1878) 7 Ch. D. 490, p.\n494\nAtt.-General v. Albany Hotel Coy. (1896) 2 Ch.\n696, pp. 699-700\nAdamson v.Wilson (1864) 10 L.T. 24 and\nChappel v. Davidson 44 E.R. 289.\nHe therefore submitted that the \"immutable\nposition\" which the Court of Appeal took in this\ncase as it did in Appeal No. F.C.A./L5/81: University\nof Lagos v. Olaniyan of the 8th of February, 1981,\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n41/102\nwherein it held that failure of the appellant to give\nor to offer an undertaking as to damages was a\nsufficient ground for discharging the order was in\nerror. The learned Senior Advocates for the\nRespondents strongly supported the opinion of the\nCourt of Appeal on the matter.\nIn my respectful opinion, neither the statement of\nthe general law nor the ratio of the cases cited by\nChief Ajayi appears to support his contention on\nthe point. The learned authors of Vol. 24 Hals. Law\nof Eng. (4th Edn.) para. 1072 at pages 596-597\nhave stated thus with respect to interlocutory\ninjunctions:\n\"An undertaking as to damages is the price which\nthe person asking for an interlocutory injunction\n44\nhas to pay for it, and it ought to be required in\nevery interlocutory order, except in High Court and\ncounty court matrimonial and children's matters\nconcerning personal conduct and except, possibly,\nin a clear case of fraud. By the undertaking the\nparty obtaining the order undertakes to abide by\nany order as to damages which the court may make\nin case it should afterwards be of opinion that the\nDefendant has, by reason of the order sustained\nany damages which such party ought to pay\"\nThis was exactly what the Court of Appeal decided\nin Olaniyan's Case. Indeed the ratio of some of the\ncases cited by the learned Senior Advocate for the\nappellant lends support to the conclusion that the\nabove is a correct statement of the law. In the case\nof Graham v. Campbell (supra) James L.J. stated\nat page 496:\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n42/102\n\" The undertaking\u00a0as\u00a0to\u00a0damages\u00a0which\u00a0ought\u00a0to\u00a0be\ngiven\u00a0on\u00a0every\u00a0interlocutory\u00a0injunction\u00a0is\u00a0one\u00a0on\nwhich\u00a0(unless\u00a0under\u00a0special\u00a0circumstances)\u00a0effect\nought to be given.\"\nWhile Chief Ajayi does not seriously dispute that an\nundertaking ought to have been given, he\nsubmitted that there are exceptions; that failure to\ngive it ought not result in the discharge of the\norder of interlocutory injunction and that in\nEngland where a Judge fails to make an order for\nan undertaking, it could be inserted by the\nRegistrar.\nThe known exceptions are not relevant in this case.\nI do not think that any Registrar of any court in\nNigeria has power to insert such an order for an\n45\nundertaking where a Judge who made the order for\nan injunction failed to order it. It is my view that a\nnecessary corollary to the fact that an undertaking\nas to damages is the price that an applicant has to\npay for the order of interlocutory injunction is that\nfailure to give the undertaking leaves the order,\nwith a quid pro quo, and, so should be a ground for\ndischarging the order. This ought to be more so in\nrespect of ex parte orders in which the order is\nbeing made without the other side being head.\nIndeed the need for it to be so is stronger in\nNigeria where no Registrar has got the power to\ninsert the order for the undertaking to be given\nwhile drawing up the order. Above all, this Court\nought to take notice of the numerous cases of\nabuse of ex-parte injunctions that have come up in\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n43/102\nrecent times. The operation of a bank has been\nhalted on an ex-parte order of injunction granted to\na person who had been removed as a director of\nthe bank. Installation ceremonies of chiefs have\nbeen halted in the same way even though the\ndispute had been dragging on for years. The\nconvocation ceremony of a university has been\nhalted on an ex parte application by two students\nwho failed their examinations. As the courts cannot\nprevent such applicants from exercising their\nconstitutional rights by stopping such applications,\nthey can, and ought, at least see that justice is\ndone to the victims of such ex-parte applications\nand orders by ensuring that the applicant fully\nundertakes to pay any damages that may be\noccasioned by any such order which may turn out\n46\nto be frivolous or improper in the end. It is,\ntherefore, my view that, save in recognized\nexceptions, no order for an interlocutory or interim\ninjunction should be made, ex parte or on notice,\nsave upon the condition that the applicant gives a\nsatisfactory undertaking as to damages. Chief Ajayi\nhas again suggested that where such an\nundertaking as to damages was necessary but not\nconsidered or given, an appellate court should\norder that it be given. I do not agree. This is for the\nsimple reason that invariably the damage, if at all,\nis done within a few days. It will serve no useful\npurpose to make an order on appeal which will\nhave the effect of, as it were, closing the stable\nafter the animal has bolted away. In my judgment,\ntherefore where a court of first instance fails to\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n44/102\nextract an undertaking as to damages where it\nshould, an appellate court ought normally to\ndischarge the order of injunction on appeal.\nChief Williams has raised the point that the whole\naction as filed by the appellant was based on\ninjuries to the company and not those personal to\nhim. He therefore raised the issue of competency of\nthe action in view of the rule in Foss v. Harbottle\n(1843) 67 E.R. 189. Relying on the case of Heyting\nv. Dupont (1963) 3 ALL E.R. 97 he submitted that\nonly the company could sue. Chief Ajayi, on the\nother hand, submitted that the appellant was\npersonally injured by the acts complained of and so\ncould bring the action. During the course of\nargument, it was revealed to us that a substantive\nappeal was pending on that issue in the Court of\n47\nAppeal. As it is so, I would not wish to pre-empt\nthat appeal by expressing an opinion on the issue\nat the moment.\nWhile considering what consequential order to\nmake, my attention was drawn to the order made\nby the Court of Appeal, Awogu, J.C.A.; in his lead\njudgment stated:\n\"The orders of Anyaegbunam made in\nF.H.C./L35/87 on April, 22, 1987, are hereby set\naside and declared null and void. The suit is\nremitted to the Federal High Court for continuation\nbefore another Judge.\"\nChief Williams in a Notice of Appeal dated 15th\nJune, 1988, has attacked this order. In his sole\nground of appeal, he contends that the Court of\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n45/102\nAppeal in omitting to strike out the plaintiff's\nMotion ex parte in view of its decision that the\nmotion was incompetent and ought not to have\nbeen granted.\nIn my view, Chief Williams is right. The decision of\nthe Court of Appeal which has been confirmed by\nthis judgment is that the learned C.J. granted the\nmotion for interlocutory injunction ex parte but\nthat he ought not to have done so. On the fact of\nthat decision there is no basis for declaring the\norder null and void. But it is one that ought to have\nbeen set aside. As the only application before the\nlearned Chief Judge was one for an interlocutory\ninjunction which as I have held, he had wrongly\ngranted ex parte, there is nothing left to be\nremitted to another Judge of the Federal High\nCourt for determination. Having held that it was in\n48\nerror, the Court of Appeal should have just said so\nand, if need be, made an order striking out the\napplication.\nFor all the reasons I have given above, the appeal\nfails and is hereby dismissed. The cross-appeal\nsucceeds and is allowed. I hereby strike out the ex\nparte application.\nThe appellant shall pay the costs of this appeal\nwhich I assess as follows:\nN500.00 in favour of the 1st Respondent;\nN500.00 in favour of the 4th to 8th Respondents.\nI have no order as to costs to the 2nd and 3rd\nRespondents.\nAUGUSTINE NNAMANI, J.S.C.\u00a0:I had a preview of the\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n46/102\njudgment just delivered by my learned brother,\nNnaemeka-Agu J.S.C. and I entirely agree with his\nreasoning and conclusions.\nMy learned brother has admirably set down the\nfacts which form the back ground to this matter and\nthey cannot bear repetition. For purposes of this\nshort concurring comment, I shall only mention\nsuch of them as are absolutely necessary.\nThe dispute in this Court appears to have started\nwith the letter dated 14th April, 1987 written by\nthe Central Bank to the plaintiff/appellant herein as\nChairman of the Society General Bank (Nigeria)\nLtd., 3rd Respondent herein. The appellant, feeling\naggrieved over some directives by the Central\nBank, filed a Suit No. F.H.C./L/2L/87 in the Federal\nHigh Court Lagos. The Suit was against the Central\nBank of Nigeria, the Attorney-General of the\n49\nFederation and the Societe Generale Bank (Nigeria)\nLtd. On the 22nd April, 1987 the appellant filed a\n\"Motion Ex-parte\" against the 2 parties mentioned\nabove (2nd and 3rd Respondents herein) praying\nfor an order:\n\"(1) Restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants their\nservants and/or agents from in any way obstructing\nor frustrating the holding of an Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant until the final\ndetermination of this suit.\n(2) For an order of injunction that until the\ndetermination of this Suit the Defendants be\nrestrained from appointing or recognizing the\nappointment of any person or persons as Directors\nof the 3rd Defendant company other than such of\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n47/102\nthem as are or may be duly appointed in\naccordance with the provisions of the Articles of\nAssociation of the Defendant Bank.\"\nAn Affidavit of\nUrgency was attached. On the same 22nd April,\n1987, Anyaegbunam, C.J. (as he then was) in effect\ngranted the relief. It is pertinent for a consideration\nof the issues here to set down the orders he made.\nThey ran thus:\n\"IT IS ORDERED AS FOLLOWS:\n1. That the 1st and 2nd Defendants/Respondents\ntheir servants and agents should not in any way\nobstruct or frustrate the holding of an Annual\nGeneral Meeting of the 3rd Defendant/Respondent\nwhenever it is fixed.\n2. That when the said Annual General Meeting is\nheld the ordinary affairs of the 3rd\nDefendant/Respondent Bank should be discussed.\n50\n3. That no new Directors will be appointed, the old\nDirectors should continue to function until the\ndetermination of this Application or the Court\notherwise directs.\n4. That 1st, 2nd and 3rd Defendants be served with\nall the motion papers. This will enable them file\nwhatever papers they wish to file.\n5. That the Application do stand adjourned till\nMonday the 27th day of April, 1987 at 1p.m.\nThe 1st Defendant/Respondent and the 4th-8th\nRespondents herein, who joined the suit later,\nappealed against this Ruling to the Court of Appeal\nThat Court (Awogu, Akpata, and Kalgo, H.C.A.) on\n2nd June, 1988 allowed the appeal and set aside\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n48/102\nthe orders. The appellant then appealed to this\nCourt.\nThe issues for determination set down by the\nlearned Senior Advocate for the 1st Respondent,\nProfessor Kasunmu, S.A.N., and paragraphs\n(ii)(a)(b) and (c) of the issues for determination as\nset down in his own brief by Chief Williams S.A.N.\nlearned Senior Advocate for 4th-8th Respondents,\nappear to me to cover the issues that arise. As\nProfessor Kasunmu put them, they were,\n(1) \"Regardless of the wording of the Rules of\nCourt, should the learned trial Judge have\nentertained the appellant's application for an\nex-parte interlocutory injunction more so in the\nparticular instance when no case of real urgency\nwas shown nor was it impossible to give notice of\nthe motion to the Respondents.\n(2) Assuming (but without conceding that) that the\n51\nlearned trial Chief Judge could take the application,\nshould he have made the various orders made on\nthe said application.\n(3) Should an undertaking as to damages not have\nbeen taken from the appellant and what is the\neffect of a failure so to do.\n\"There does not appear to have been much\ndifficulty in this appeal about the different meaning\nand implication of interim and interlocutory\ninjunctions. It was generally agreed that an\ninterlocutory injunction is one pending the\ndetermination of the Suit while an interim\ninjunction is one granted to last a few days or until\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n49/102\nfurther order. In the case of an interim injunction,\nit is usually named to a definite date pending the\nhearing of a motion on notice between the parties.\nSee Beese v. Woodhouse (1970) 1 ALL E.R. 769;\n(1970) 1 W.L.R. 586; Re Johnson ex parte Abrams\n(1884) 50 L.T. 184; Allport v. Securities\nCorporation (1895) 64 L.J. CH. 491; Beecham\nGroup Ltd. v. Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd . 118\nC.L.R. 618, 623. Also Halsburys Laws of England\nVol. 24, 4th Edition para, 904 and fig. It seems\nunarguable that the motion here as framed by the\nappellant is for an interlocutory injunction for it is\n\"pending the determination of the Suit.\" It seems\nto me too that there was agreement that exparte\ninjunction (whether interim or interlocutory) can be\ngranted by the courts provided there is real\nurgency. An ex-parte interim injunction can be\ngranted where the Judge considers on a prima facie\nview that otherwise irreparable damage may be\n52\ndone to the plaintiff before an application for\ninterlocutory injunction can be heard after notice\nhas been given to the opposing party. See\nAmerican Cynamid Coy v. Ethicon Ltd. (1975) A.C.\n396.\nIn the same way, an interlocutory injunction\ncan be granted ex parte in cases of real urgency or\nas stated above where it is necessary to preserve\nthe res. As to the latter see Thomas A. Edison Ltd.\nv. Bullock (1912) 15 C.L.R. 679, 681. Because of\nthe nature of interlocutory injunction and the\nprinciples governing its grant, which presupposes\nsome contest between the parties (see Heavener v.\nLoomes 34 C.L.R. 306, 326 and Obeya Memorial\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n50/102\nHospital v. Attorney General of the Federation\n(1987) 3 N.W.L.R. (Pt.60) 325, it is usual to\nemphasize that this jurisdiction to grant an\ninterlocutory injunction ex parte is an\nextraordinary jurisdiction. It is for this reason that\nin the case of real urgency, the court scrutinizes\nthe application to ensure that there is in fact\nurgency and that the applicant has not been guilty\nof delay. In the case of ex parte interlocutory\ninjunction to preserve a res, it is usual to file a\nmotion on notice at the same time as the motion ex\nparte is filed. Whatever order is made stands until\nthe motion on notice is taken.\nThe extraordinary jurisdiction being exercised in\nex-parte interlocutory injunctions, or its being out\nof the ordinary is brought out in the words of\nGriffith, C.J. in Thomas Edison Ltd. (supra) at page\n681 where he said,\n\"There is a primary percept governing the\n53\nadministration of justice, that no man is to be\ncondemned unheard; and therefore, as a general\nrule, no order should be made to the prejudice of a\nparty unless he has the opportunity of being heard\nin defence. But instances occur where justice could\nnot be done unless the subject-matter of the suit\nwere preserved, and if that is in danger of\ndestruction by one party, or if irremediable or\nserious damage be imminent, the other may come\nto the court, and ask for interposition even in the\nabsence of his opponent, on the ground that delay\nwould involve greater injustice than instant action.\nBut when he does so, and the Court is asked to\ndisregard the usual requirement of hearing the\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n51/102\nother side, the party moving incurs a most serious\nresponsibility.\"\nThe real issue, therefore, in this appeal is, as stated\nin the issues for determination, whether there were\ncircumstances here justifying the grant of\ninterlocutory injunction ex parte. More directly, was\nthere real urgency? Usually in cases of ex-parte\napplications for injunction on the ground of real\nurgency in the court would, as indicated earlier,\nexamine the fact to ensure that the party applying\nhas not been guilty of delay and furthermore that\nthere is an impossibility of bringing an application\non notice and serving the other party. In Bates v.\nLord Halisham (1972) 3 ALL E.R. 1019. Megarry J.\n(as he then was) held that the applicants could not\nmeet the above standards and so refused the\napplication. At page 1025 he made remarks which\nare quite relevant to the circumstances of the\n54\ninstant suit. He said,\n\"There are, of course,\noccasions when circumstances make an earlier\napplication impossible. But here, the dates speak\nfor themselves. The announcement by the Lord\nChancellor of the proposal to abolish scale fees\naltogether was made over two and half months ago.\nThe association's first circular was sent out at about\nthe same time. The draft order was published\nnearly a month ago. Well over three weeks ago it\nwas in the hands of Solicitors generally. Not until a\nweek ago did the association send its submissions\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n52/102\nto the Committee, following them up with individual\nletters some five days ago. For nearly three weeks\nthe association has known that the Committee was\nto meet today. On these facts counsel for the\nplaintiff did his best, but the material was\nintractable. An injunction is a serious matter and\nmust be treated seriously. If there is a plaintiff who\nhas known about a proposal for ten weeks in\ngeneral terms and for nearly three weeks in detail,\nand he wants an injunction to prevent effect being\ngiven to it at a meeting of which he has known for\nwell over a fortnight, he must have a most cogent\nexplanation if he is to obtain his injunction on an\nex-parte application made two and half hours\nbefore the meeting is due to begin. It is no answer\nto say, as Counsel for the plaintiff sought to say,\nthat the grant of an injunction will do the\nDefendants no harm, for apart from other\nconsiderations, an inference from an insufficiently\nexplained tardiness in the application is that the\nurgency and the gravity of the plaintiffs case are\n55\nless than compelling.\nEx-parte injunctions are for cases of real urgency,\nwhere there has been a true impossibility of giving\nnotice of motion.\"\nIn the instant suit, the appellant\nin his affidavit of urgency stated the urgency in\nparagraphs 3, 4 and 5 therein. In effect he referred\nto the letter of the Central Bank dated 14th April,\n1987 which he received on 16th April, 1987. He\nmentioned that an Annual General Meeting of the\n3rd Respondent Bank had been fixed for 25th April,\n1987 and notices for the said meeting were sent on\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n53/102\n26th March, 1987.\nHe then mentioned in paragraph 5 that the 1st\nRespondent had in the said letter of 14th April\ndirected that the Nigerian Directors of the 3rd\nRespondent do meet urgently to select its\nrepresentatives on the Board of the Bank and that\nthe list be forwarded to the 1st Respondent within\n10 days of the letter. The letter, he said, had\nthreatened appropriate measures if the list of\nDirectors was not sent within 10 days. From these\nfacts, it can be seen that the appellant did nothing\nsince 16th April, 1987 when he received the said\nletter from the 1st Respondent. It was not until\n22nd April, three days to the meeting which was\nscheduled on the 25th April, and two days to the\ndeadline given him by the 1st Respondent, that he\nbrought his application for injunctive relief. Surely\nif there was any emergency, it was one induced by\nhis lethargy and tardiness. Besides, there were\nthree clear days to the scheduled Annual General\nMeeting and two days before the 1st Respondent's\n56\ndeadline. Why was it impossible for the appellant to\nserve his motion papers on the Respondents\nparticularly as all of them are resident in Lagos? I\nam also of the view that the Court of Appeal was\nright in its conclusion that there was no real\nurgency that would have justified granting the\ninterlocutory injunctive relief ex- parte as the\nlearned Chief Judge did.\nThe other matter I would wish to touch briefly is\nthis. It seems to me that from all the authorities,\nwhere an application for interlocutory injunction is\nmade ex parte, and the court cannot see any facts\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n54/102\nshowing real urgency or a desire to preserve a res\nfrom imminent destruction or that there is an\nimpossibility of service of the motion on the other\nparty, the court should either refuse it or order that\nthe other party be put on notice and so served with\nall the relevant papers. The court will then\ndetermine the application by the principles for\ngranting interlocutory injunction. In my view that\nought to be the proper role of Order 33 Rule 10 of\nthe Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules 1st\nand 3rd Options. It seems to me that if Order 33 is\ncited as authority for all ex-parte applications for\ninterlocutory injunctions no matter the facts, the\nquestion of conflict with Section 33 of the\nConstitution would surely arise.\nLearned Senior Advocate for the appellant, Chief\nAjayi, S.A.N. actually submitted to this court that\nthe learned trial Chief Judge acted under Order 33\nRule 10 3rd option. He said the learned Chief Judge\nmade interim order on the live issues and directed\n57\nthat all the papers be served on the Respondent for\nhearing on 27th April, 1987. I had previously set\ndown the orders made by the learned Chief Judge.\nOrders 4 and 5 would on the face of them appear to\nbear out learned Counsel's submission. But having\nregard to the nature of the orders made what was\nthere to discuss on the 27th April? For one thing,\nthe Annual General Meeting scheduled for 25th\nApril would have been held. Furthermore, were the\nother orders made interim orders? Certainly not.\nThey were absolute, final orders which seem to\nhave given the appellant some of the reliefs he\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n55/102\nclaimed in his statement of claim. For instance, the\nfirst order made by the learned Chief Judge was in\neffect the same as the claim in paragraph 26(ix) of\nthe appellant's statement of claim. There the\nappellant claimed \"an injunction restraining the 1st\nand 2nd Defendants from in any way obstructing or\nfrustrating the holding of the Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank for the\npurposes of electing new Directors or effecting any\nof the Statutory purposes for which Annual General\nMeetings are required to be held by the Companies\nAct, 1968.\"\nThe learned Chief Judge did not act under the 3rd\noption of Order 33 Rule 10.\nFinally, the question of undertaking to pay\ndamages which is the third issue for determination has been exhaustively dealt with by my learned brother in the lead judgment. I merely wish to associate myself with\nthe view that, having regard to the manner\nex-parte injunctions have lately been used in this country, an\n58\nundertaking to pay damages must be extracted\nbefore the grant of such injunctions.

Campbell and\nGriffith v. Blake, seem to me to suggest that the\nundertaking for damages is much more than the\nrule of practice which Chief Ajayi made it out to be.\nBesides one must take cognisance of the difference\nin the practice of the courts in England and our\nCourts. While a Registrar may insert an\nundertaking to pay damages in a drawn up order\nwhere the trial Court has failed to record such an\nundertaking in England no Registrar could do that\nin Nigeria. Chief Ajayi has submitted that rather\n59\nthan set aside the orders where the trial Court\nwhich granted them has not extracted any\nundertaking, the Court of Appeal ought to extract\nthe undertaking. I just suspect that the damage\nmay well have been suffered by the Defendant\nbefore reaching the Court of Appeal. Besides, the\nCourt of Appeal could be accused of intervening on\none side of the dispute.\nI too would, and do, dismiss this appeal. I abide\nby all the orders made by Nnaemeka-Agu, J .S.c.,\nincluding the order for costs.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n57/102\nADOLPHUS GODWIN KARIBI-WHYTE, J.S.C. \u00a0:I have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of my learned\nbrother, Nnaemeka-Agu, J.S.C., just delivered. I\nagree with his reasoning and conclusions that this\nappeal from the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division,\nfails and should be dismissed. I will refrain from\nstating the facts of the case in any detail. This has\nbeen very fully stated in my learned brother,\nNnaemeka-Agu's judgment.\nThe salient facts in this appeal may be briefly\nstated as follows. Appellant is the Chairman of the\nBoard of Directors of the 3rd Respondent Bank; a\nlimited liability company. The 1st Defendant, is the\ninstitution statutorily charged with the supervision\nof the 3rd Defendant Bank of which\nappellant/plaintiff is the Chairman. As a result of\ncertain complaints made to it about the\nadministration of the 3rd Respondent Bank, the 1st\nRespondent acting by virtue of powers under\nSection 22 of the Banking Act 1969 addressed a\n60\nletter to the 3rd Respondent dated 14th April,\n1987, but received on the 16th giving the following\ndirectives:\n(a) that both appellant and the 7th Respondent\nrevert to their status quo as at the date of their\nMeeting with the Minister of Finance in 1982.\n(b) That all shares acquired by each of them\nafter that date be offered for sale to other\nNigerians.\n(c) That a new Board of Directors of the 3rd\nRespondent Bank shall be appointed, and that in\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n58/102\nsuch new Board of Directors of the Bank, no person\nwho has previously served as a Director of the\nBank be appointed.\n(d) That the Nigerian Shareholders should meet\nas a group within ten days to nominate Nigerians to\nserve on the new Board of Directors of the 3rd\nRespondent Bank.\nThis directive was given nine days before the\nstatutory Annual General Meeting of the 3rd\nRespondent Bank which was fixed for April 25,\n1987. On the 22nd April, 1987 appellant filed a\nwrit of summons claiming as follows:\n\"(i) A Declaration that the directive given by the\n1st Defendant in its letter DG/COMBANKS\n/Vol.1/359 of the 14th April, 1987 to the effect that\nthe shareholding of the plaintiff in the 3rd\nDefendant should revert to the reduced figure of\nN2,937 ,450 shares held by him in 1982 is ultra\nvires the 1st Defendant and is null and void.\n(ii) A Declaration that the directive given by the 1st\nDefendant in the said letter that all shares acquired\n61\nby the plaintiff in the 3rd Defendant since 1982 be\ndivested to other Nigerians is ultra vires the 1st\nDefendant.\n(iii) A Declaration that the plaintiff is owner of\n8,386,000 shares of N1.00 each in the 3rd\nDefendant Bank\n(iv) A Declaration that the directive of the 1st\nDefendant that a fresh Board of the 3rd Defendant\nbe reconstituted so that former member of the\nBoard be not re-appointed thereto is:\n(a) ultra vires the 1st Defendant and void; and\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n59/102\n(b) is an unwarranted interference with the affairs\nof the company as constituted.\n(c) an unwarranted interference with the plaintiff's\nrights to be re-elected a Director under the Articles\nof Association of the Bank.\n(v) A Declaration that the plaintiff is entitled to be\nre-appointed a Director of the 3rd Defendant Bank\nat its scheduled Annual General Meeting fixed for\nthe 25th of April, 1987 in accordance with the\nprovisions of Articles 96, 97 and 98 of the Articles\nof Association of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\n(vi) A Declaration that the directive given by the\nFederal Ministry of Finance by letter dated the 6th\nday of April, 1987 to the effect that the Annual\nGeneral Meeting of the Bank fixed for the 25th\nApril, 1987 be postponed until a new Board of\nDirectors is constituted is ultra vires, null and void.\n(vii) A Declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to\nremain in office as a Director of the 3rd Defendant\nBank until he is removed from office in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Companies Act or the\n62\nArticles of Association of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\n(viii) An injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd\nDefendants from exercising any of their respective\npowers whether under the Banking Act or under\nthe Companies Act in such a way as to give effect\nto or provide sanctions against the plaintiff for\nfailure to give effect to any of the aforesaid\ndirectives of the 1st Defendant.\n(ix) An injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd\nDefendants from in any way obstructing or\nfrustrating the holding of the Annual General\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n60/102\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank for the\npurposes of electing new Directors or affecting any\nof the Statutory purposes for which Annual General\nMeetings are required to be held by the Companies\nAct 1968.\" Simultaneously he also filed a motion ex\nparte under Order 20 of the Federal High Court\nRules 1976, praying the Federal High Court to\n(i) Restrain the 1st and 2nd Defendants (now\nRespondents) their servants and/or agents from in\nany way obstructing or frustrating the holding of\nthe Annual General Meeting of the 3rd Defendant\nBank until the final determination of this suit.\n(ii) For an order of injunction that until the\ndetermination of this suit, the Defendants be\nrestrained from appointing or recognizing the\nappointment of any person or persons as Directors\nof the 3rd Defendant Company other than such of\nthem as are or may be duly appointed in\naccordance with the provisions of the Articles of\nAssociation of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\nThe application which was supported by an affidavit\n63\nof urgency also prayed for such order or orders as\nthe Honorable Court may deem fit to make in the\ncircumstances. The words underlined undoubtedly\nrefer to the substantive suit filed. I reproduce the\naverments in the affidavit of urgency relied upon\nby the applicant/appellant in support of the motion\nex parte.\n\"2. That I am the Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\n3. That Notice summoning the Annual General\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n61/102\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank for the 25th of\nApril, 1987 was issued on the 26th of March,\n1987.\n4. That on the morning of Thursday the 16th of\nApril, 1987, I returned home a little after 12 noon\nand was shown a letter addressed to me by the 1st\nDefendant herein directing that the Nigerian\nDirectors of the 3rd Defendant Bank do meet\nurgently and to select its representatives on the\nBoard of the Bank and forward a list thereof to the\n1st Defendant within 10 days of the letter. The said\nletter is dated the 14th April, 1987 and a copy of\nthe same is already exhibited to the Affidavit in\nsupport of the Motion filed herein.\n5. That the 1st Defendant has threatened in its\naforesaid letter that if the list of new Directors is\nnot supplied to it within 10 days of the said letter it\nwould take appropriate measures against the 3rd\nDefendant under the Banking Act.\n6. That I have therefore commenced these\nproceedings seeking a number of declarations and\ninjunctive relief.\n64\n7. That I have also filed an ex-parte Motion for\ninterim injunction and it is of crucial importance\nthat this application for interim injunction be heard\nimmediately in view of the fact that the Annual\nGeneral Meeting of the Bank is due to be held at\nthe end of this week and the time limit within\nwhich the 1st Defendant has demanded a list of\nDirectors will expire on the 24th April, 1987.\n8. That I therefore pray that this application be\nheard as a matter of urgency.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n62/102\nAttached to the ex-parte motion was an affidavit, a\nstatement of claim, and the Memorandum and\nArticles of Association of the 3rd\nDefendant/Respondent Bank.\nThe motion ex parte praying for orders of\ninjunction was heard and granted by the learned\nChief Judge of the Federal High Court on the 22nd\nApril, 1987, the day it was filed. The enrolled order\nof the Court states as follows:\n\"(1) That the 1st and 2nd Defendants/Respondents\ntheir servants and agents should not in any way\nobstruct or frustrate the holding of the Annual\nGeneral Meeting of the 3rd Defendant/Respondent\nwhenever it is fixed.\n(2) That when the said Annual General Meeting is\nheld the ordinary affairs of the 3rd\nDefendant/Respondent Bank should be discussed.\n(3) That no new Directors will be appointed, the old\nDirectors should continue to function until the\ndetermination of this application or the Court\notherwise orders.\n(4) That 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Defendants/Respondents\n65\nbe served with all the motion papers. This will\nenable them file whatever papers they wish to file\n(5) That the application do stand adjourned till\nMonday the 27th day of April, 1987 at 1 p.m.\"\nThe 1st Defendant/Respondent filed an appeal to\nthe Court of Appeal against the orders made. The\nfour Grounds of Appeal are as follows\n\"1. Having regard to the fact that the plaintiff's\napplication was for an order of injunction ex parte\nuntil the final determination of this suit which\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n63/102\napplication is irregular and improper having regard\nto decisions of the Court of Appeal (which decisions\nare binding on the trial Court) the learned trial\nJudge erred in law in entertaining the application\nwhen it should have been struck out.\n1n the alternative,\n2. The learned trial Judge erred in law in dealing\nwith the plaintiff's application ex-parte when having\nregard to the affidavit evidence before the Court,\nno reason of extreme urgency or emergency was\nshown for not putting the Defendants on notice.\n3. The learned trial Judge erred in law in making\nthe order of injunction dated the 22nd of April,\n1987 without extracting from the plaintiff/\napplicant an undertaking for damages having\nregard to decisions of the Court of Appeal which\ndecisions are binding on the trial Court on the need\nfor the taking of such an undertaking.\n4. The order of Court \"that no new Directors will be\nappointed, the old Directors should continue to\nfunction until the determination of this application\nor the Court otherwise orders\" is vague, irregular\n66\nand improper in that\n(a) the order made by the trial Court was not what\nthe Applicant requested for;\n(b) having disposed of the motion ex parte there\nwas no other application pending before the Court\non which the order could be said to be dependent\nupon;\n(c) the order of the trial Court was in effect the\ngranting of an injunction ex parte for an indefinite\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n64/102\nduration without hearing the Defendant. \"\nIn the determination of the appeal in the Court\nbelow, the court accepted as sufficient formulation\nof the issues raised to be whether or not the order\nwere properly made on an ex-parte application.\nIn their judgment, the Court of Appeal held that\nthe application was brought under Order 20, but\nwas treated by the learned Chief Judge as if it was\nbrought under Order 33 rule 3 of the Federal High\nCourt Rules 1976. After a discussion of the\nprovisions of Order 33 rule 3, the Court of Appeal\nheld that, \". . . it is clear that what the Court\nordered was in the nature of an immediate absolute\norder.\" This is because although the meeting was\nscheduled for the 25th April, 1987, the order which\nwas for \"whenever it is fixed\" could not be said to\nbe in the nature of an interim order. The Court of\nAppeal said \"The absolutism of the order was\nclearly beyond doubt, the more so as further\nhearing was fixed after 25/4/87.\"\nThe Court of Appeal also considered the question\nwhether or not a case of real urgency was made\nout, and held that no case of real urgency was\n67\ndisclosed in the affidavit of urgency in support of\nthe application.\nThe Court held that the affidavit of urgency filed in\nsupport of the applicant did not contain any\naverments of real urgency or exceptional\ncircumstances to warrant the granting of the orders\nsought. The second order which restricted the\nagenda of the Annual General Meeting to the\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n65/102\nordinary affairs of the 3rd Defendant/Respondent\nBank, thereby excluding appointment of Directors\nwas held to have been made gratuitously as it was\nnot one of the prayers sought. The 3rd Order which\nprohibited the appointment of new Directors, thus\nenabling the existing Directors to continue to\nfunction until the determination of the application,\nwas held to be inconsistent with the prayer that\nthere should be no appointment or recognition of\nany appointment other than in accordance with the\nprovisions of the Articles of Association.\nFinally, the Court below referred to the case of\nOjukwu v. Governor, Lagos State (1986) 3 N. W. L.\nR. (Pt.26) 39 where it was held that where an\napplication was made ex parte, praying for an order\nuntil the final determination of the suit, the\napplication should not be taken ex parte.\nApplicant/Respondent, not satisfied with this\njudgment has now appealed to this Court. Ten\nGrounds of Appeal were filed. I do not consider it\nnecessary to set out the grounds of appeal which\ncovered every reasoning of the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeal. I think it will be sufficient for my\npurpose to rely on the formulation by counsel of\n68\nissues which arise for determination which\nadequately encompass all the grounds of appeal.\nCounsel to the appellant, Chief G. O. K. Ajayi,\nS.A.N., has formulated the issue differently from\nthe 1st Respondent. The formulation of the issue by\ncounsel for the appellant is as follows:\n\"Was the order of Anyaegbunam, C.J., now under\nappeal an immediate absolute order or was it an\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n66/102\norder directing that the parties likely to be affected\nbe put on notice coupled with an interim order\nmade to subsist until the parties could be heard.\"\nLearned Senior Counsel to the 1st Respondent,\nProfessor A. B. Kasunmu, S.A.N., rejected this\nformulation of the issues to be determined and\nformulated the issues as follows:\n\"The 1st Respondent does not agree with the\nformulation of the issues as set out in the\nappellant's brief. The issues for determination in\nthis appeal as hereinafter formulated (though\ndifferently worded) are almost similar to the issues\nplaced before the Court of Appeal for determination\nnamely:\n(1) Regardless of the wording of the rules of Court,\nshould the learned trial Judge have entertained the\nappellant's application for an ex parte interlocutory\ninjunction more so in the particular instance when\nno case of real urgency was shown nor was it\nimpossible to give notice of the motion to the\nRespondents.\n(2) Assuming (but without conceding) that the\nlearned Chief Judge could take the application,\nshould he have made the various orders made on\n69\nthe said application.\n(3) Should an undertaking as to damages not have\nbeen taken from the appellant and what is the\neffect of a failure so to do.\" Counsel to the 4th-8th\nRespondents who applied and was granted leave to\nbe joined in the Court below, agreed with the\nformulation of the issues to be determined by the\nCourt, but the wording was differently couched as\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n67/102\nfollows:\nIt is respectfully submitted that the questions for\ndetermination in this appeal are as follows:\n(i) Whether the High Court had jurisdiction to\nentertain the motion ex parte or, indeed, the claims\nrelevant to that motion.\n(ii) If, but only if the answer to Question (i) is in\nthe negative:\n(a) Whether the court below was correct in deciding\nthat the Federal High Court ought not to have\nentertained the plaintiff's application.\n(b) Whether the court below was correct in saying\nthat there were no exceptional circumstances to\njustify the grant of interlocutory injunctions by ex\nparte orders in this case, and\n(c) Whether the court was correct in setting aside\nthe order on the ground also that the plaintiff gave\nno undertaking as to damages in respect of the\ninjunction.\n\"I agree with the latter formulation of the issues\nand adopt it in this judgment. Concisely stated the\nissues to be determined in the appeal before us as\nin the Court of Appeal are,\n(1) Whether the learned trial Judge was right in\n70\nmaking the orders he made on the ex parte\napplication before him.\n(2) Whether the absence of an undertaking to pay\ncosts rendered the orders made on the ex parte\napplication invalid.\nI shall now turn to the submissions of Counsel in\nthis appeal. Chief G. O. K. Ajayi, S.A.N., adopted\nhis brief of argument filed and founded his\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n68/102\nargument on the submission that the Order made\nshould be interpreted within the general context in\nwhich it was made and in the light of the\ndocuments placed before the Court and the\nsubmissions by Counsel. The five orders made, he\nurged, should be read together within the\nframework of Order 20 rules 4 and 5, Order 33\nrules 8 and 10, Rules of the Federal High Court,\n1976. Learned Senior Counsel pointed out that the\nthird Order was clearly made \"until the\ndetermination of this application\" and the fourth\ndirected service of all the Motion papers on the\nDefendants. Counsel therefore submitted that\n(a) The learned Chief Judge did not consider\nhimself as having determined the application before\nhim as an ex parte application.\n(b) He knew he was making an interim order until\nthe determination of the application.\n(c) The application before him was to be\ndetermined only after notice to the parties affected\nwho were given opportunity to file whatever papers\nthey wished.\n(d) The ex parte application was to be heard by the\nlearned Chief Judge on the 27th of April, 1987.\n71\n(e) In any event in making these orders, the\nlearned Chief Judge was acting within the\nprovisions of Order 20 rule 5 and Order 33 rule 10\nof the Federal High Court Civil Procedure Rules\n1976.\nLearned Senior Counsel referred to the third order\nwhere the learned Chief Judge stated that the order\nthat the existing directors should continue in office\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n69/102\nuntil the determination of this application or the\ncourt otherwise orders, was not restraining the\nappointment of new directors as proposed by them\nuntil the determination of the suit. It was submitted\nthat the order was directed at the 1st and 2nd\nRespondents, who alone were concerned in the\napplication. It did not extend to the main prayer on\nthe interlocutory injunction which was to operate\nuntil the determination of the suit.\nCounsel further referred to the practice in ex parte\napplications where an interim order to last for a few\ndays is usually followed by notice to the other\nparty. This is the practice provided for in Order 20\nrule 5 and Order 33 rule 10. This, it was submitted,\nwas what the learned Chief Judge did.\nLearned Senior Counsel rejected the holding that\nthe learned Chief Judge made any absolute orders.\nHe submitted that the order on the holding of the\nroutine annual general meeting was not an order\non an issue which was in dispute between parties.\nIt was this order that was being regarded as an\nabsolute order.\nOn the holding by the Court of Appeal in the Order,\nthat the learned Chief Judge granted more than\n72\nwas asked for, the learned Senior Counsel\nsubmitted that that was not the effect of the order.\nFirst, the existing directors were to function until\nthe determination of this application. Secondly,\nthat 1st and 2nd Defendants should be restrained\nfrom exercising the powers to remove the directors,\nwho only should be removed in accordance with the\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n70/102\nArticles of Association of the 3rd Defendant Bank. It\nwas submitted that the ex parte order only\npreserved the status of the plaintiff/appellant as\nDirector until the parties were served with the\nMotion Papers, and they came to Court on the 27th\nApril, 1987.\nReferring to the words of the 3rd and 5th Orders,\nCounsel submitted that it cannot be said that the\nlearned Chief Judge had disposed of the ex parte\napplication before him. The live issue as to the\nappointment of Directors was reserved for\ndetermination after service on the Defendants.\nLearned Counsel submitted that the Court of Appeal\nwas wrong to have relied on the averments in the\naffidavit of urgency for the determination whether\nthe application ought to be granted as distinct from\nwhether the court should have heard the motion ex\nparte urgently. It was submitted that having heard\nthe motion ex parte the purpose of the affidavit of\nurgency was spent. The question whether the\nprayers should be granted depended on other\nconsiderations.\nCounsel argued that the requirement of an\nundertaking for damages in an interlocutory\ninjunction is a rule of practice. An omission to\n73\nextract the under did not render the order for\ninterlocutory injunction ipso facto liable to be set\naside on appeal. Since the initiative to demand an\nundertaking for damages in interlocutory injunction\nlies with the court, and it is discretionary, its\nabsence should not affect the order made.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n71/102\nOn the facts of this case, only the Central Bank, 1st\nDefendant complained against the order of the\nlearned Chief Judge. The 2nd & 3rd, 4th-8th\nDefendants were not parties to the suit when the\norder for interim injunction was made; and no\norder was made against them.\nThere is no evidence on the record that the 1st\nDefendant was likely to suffer any damage\nfinancially or materially as a result of the grant of\nthe injunction to make it necessary to extract\nundertaking for damages. Even if the facts were\nthat an undertaking for damages was necessary,\nthe Court of Appeal instead of setting aside the\norder of injunction should direct the plaintiff to give\nthe undertaking.\nThe above are summarily stated, the submissions of\nlearned Counsel for the appellant.\nIt is a fundamental\u00a0principle\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0administration\u00a0of\njustice\u00a0in\u00a0civil\u00a0cases,\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0court\u00a0is\u00a0limited\u00a0and\ncircumscribed\u00a0in\u00a0what\u00a0it\u00a0can\u00a0grant\u00a0or\u00a0the\u00a0awards\u00a0it\ncan\u00a0make\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0claim\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Plaintiff.\u00a0He\u00a0is\u00a0not\nentitled\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0awarded\u00a0more. In Ekpenyong & Ors.\nv. Inyang Nyong & Ors. (1975) 2 S.C. 71, 80, this\nCourt declared:\n\"The Court is without power to award to claimant\nthat which he did not claim. We take the view\n74\nthat this proposition of the law is not only good law\nbut good sense. A court of law may award less, and\nnot more than what the parties have claimed or\npleaded by either party.\" See also Ochonma v.\nUnosi (1965) N.M.L.R. 321. It is pertinent to this\nappeal to point out that the appellant brought his\napplication under Order XX of the Federal High\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n72/102\nCourt Rules, 1976. He has argued in his brief that\nhe relied on Order XX rules 4 and 5, which provide\nin the provision as follows:\nThe provision to Order XX rule 4 which is relevant\nprovides:\n\"Provided always that any order for an injunction\nmay be discharged or varied or set aside by the\ncourt on application made thereto by any party\ndissatisfied with such order.\"\nOrder XX deals with injunctions generally and the\nmain rule of Rule 4 is construable to include\napplications by motion for interlocutory and\nperpetual injunctions, on notice. For instance rule 5\nof order XX provides:\n\"The Court may, in every case, before granting an\ninjunction or order as aforesaid, direct such\nreasonable notice of the application of the same to\nbe given to the opposite party as it may seem fit.\"\nThus Rule 5 appears to provide expressly that an\napplication for injunction cannot be granted unless\nreasonable notice of the application has been given\nto the opposite party. Thus, applications for\ninjunction to be granted without notice to the\nparties to be affected, known as ex parte\napplications, do not come within the Rule. It is\n75\nimportant to advert to the expression \"in every\ncase\" in Rule 5 which is the last rule in Order XX,\nand which governs all the other rules relating to\napplications for injunctions. Thus the phrase in\nevery case means in all applications under Order\nXX Rule 4, which contemplate interlocutory\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n73/102\napplications for injunctions. I do not think the word\n\"may\" in Rule 5 can be interpreted as predatory. I\nthink it is intended to be mandatory. Thus, an\napplication for injunction under Order XX can only\nbe by motion on notice.\nBut Order XXXIII provides generally for\ninterlocutory applications and contemplate such\napplications as under Order XX. Particular mention\nof Order XXXIII rule 7 provides that interlocutory\napplications may be made ex parte or after notice\nto the parties affected thereby is necessary.\nSimilarly, Order XXXIII rules 8 and 10 which deal\nwith ex parte applications are important as laying\ndown the orders which the Court can make on\ninterlocutory applications. Rule 8 provides that on a\nmotion ex parte, the applicant shall ask for\n(i) An immediate absolute order of the Court, in the\nterms of the motion paper and affidavit in support,\nor\n(ii) An order on the other party to appear on a\ncertain day, to show cause why the order should\nnot be made in terms of the motion paper.\nThe Court may, as provided by Rule 10\n(a) Refuse to make the order sought\n(b) Grant an order to show cause why the order\nshould not be made\n76\n(c) Allow the motion to be made on notice to the\nparties to be affected thereby.\nThus, an ex parte application is one made and could\nbe granted without notice to the party affected by\nthe order sought in the application. An application\nfor injunction made after the commencement of the\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n74/102\nsuit and before judgment is undoubtedly\ninterlocutory and comes within the purview of Order\nXXXIII. Such application can be made ex parte.\nAlthough an ex parte application for injunction can\nbe made, the court may refuse to make the order\nsought where the interest of justice demands that\nthe other party to be affected ought to be put on\nnotice, or it will be contrary to the general\nprovisions of the law or inconsistent with the\ninterest of justice.\nIt is important to consider the provision of Rule 10\nas to the orders the Court may make on ex parte\napplications made under order XXXIII rule 8. It\nseems to me that although Rule 8 enables an\napplication ex parte to ask for an immediate\nabsolute order of the court in terms of the motion\npaper and evidence, the court may refuse the order\nsought, or grant an order to show cause why the\norder should not be made, or may allow the parties\nto be affected to be put on notice. The court is not\nallowed to grant the order sought in the application\nex parte, i.e. without notice to the parties to be\naffected. It cannot grant an order sought in\nabsolute terms because Rule 10 clearly limits the\norders it can make to those prescribed therein. The\nexpress mention of the refusal to grant the order\n77\nsought in absolute terms excludes the possibility of\na grant. This is strengthened by the orders which\ncan be made. The rule is therefore consistent with\nthe provisions of section 33(1) of the Constitution\n1979 which prohibits the making of a determination\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n75/102\naffecting the civil rights and obligations of a person\nwithout hearing him.\nIt\u00a0is\u00a0useful\u00a0to\u00a0examine\u00a0the\u00a0meaning\u00a0and\u00a0scope\u00a0of\nthe\u00a0words\u00a0\"interlocutory\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"interim\"\u00a0which\u00a0have\nbeen\u00a0used\u00a0very\u00a0freely\u00a0and\u00a0often\u00a0times\u00a0regarded\u00a0as\ninterchangeable\u00a0in\u00a0applications\u00a0for\u00a0injunctions.\u00a0See\nKufeji\u00a0v.\u00a0Kogbe\u00a0(1961)\u00a01\u00a0All\u00a0N.L.R.\u00a0113;\u00a0Iroegbu\u00a0v.\nUgbo\u00a0(1970-71)\u00a01\u00a0E.C.S.L.R.\u00a0162.\nAn\u00a0interlocutory\u00a0application\u00a0\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0application\nwhich\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0made\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0course\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0proceeding,\nand\u00a0at\u00a0any\u00a0stage\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0cause\u00a0or\u00a0matter,\u00a0for\u00a0the\npurpose\u00a0of\u00a0keeping\u00a0the\u00a0parties\u00a0in\u00a0status\u00a0quo\u00a0till\u00a0the\ndetermination\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0action\u00a0-\u00a0See Obeya\u00a0Memorial\nSpecialist\u00a0\u00a0Hospital\u00a0v.\u00a0Attorney-General\u00a0for\u00a0\u00a0the\nFederation\u00a0(1987)\u00a03\u00a0N.W.L.R.\u00a0(Pt.60)\u00a0325.\u00a0Ojukwu\nv.\u00a0Governor\u00a0of\u00a0Lagos\u00a0State\u00a0(1986)\u00a03\u00a0N.\u00a0W.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\n(Pt.26)\u00a039.\nThe\u00a0word\u00a0\"interim\"\u00a0used\u00a0also\u00a0in\u00a0applications\u00a0and\norders\u00a0of\u00a0injunction\u00a0for\u00a0maintaining\u00a0the\u00a0status\u00a0quo\nof\u00a0parties\u00a0to\u00a0a\u00a0suit\u00a0means\u00a0\"temporary\",\u00a0\"in\u00a0the\nmean\u00a0time.\"\u00a0However\u00a0an\u00a0injunction\u00a0described\u00a0as\ninterim\u00a0falls\u00a0within\u00a0the\u00a0above\u00a0definition\u00a0and\u00a0is\u00a0an\ninterlocutory\u00a0injunction\u00a0because\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0application\nmade\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0course\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0proceedings.\u00a0But\u00a0unlike\nan\u00a0interlocutory\u00a0injunction\u00a0properly\u00a0so\u00a0called,\u00a0an\ninterim\u00a0injunction\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0one\u00a0granted\u00a0till\u00a0the\ndetermination\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0suit.\u00a0It\u00a0is\u00a0an\u00a0injunction\u00a0made\n78\nuntil\u00a0a\u00a0named\u00a0date\u00a0or\u00a0until\u00a0further\u00a0order\u00a0or\u00a0until\u00a0an\napplication\u00a0on\u00a0notice\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0heard.\u00a0Thus\u00a0they\u00a0bear\nall\u00a0the\u00a0features\u00a0and\u00a0trappings\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0interlocutory\ninjunction\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0granted\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0upon\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0same\nconsideration\u00a0\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0equity.\u00a0\u00a0Interim\u00a0\u00a0orders\u00a0\u00a0for\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n76/102\ninjunction\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0made\u00a0pending\u00a0motion\u00a0on\u00a0notice\u00a0of\nan\u00a0interlocutory\u00a0injunction\u00a0where\u00a0applicant\u00a0is\u00a0able\nto\u00a0show\u00a0that\u00a0irretrievable\u00a0damage\u00a0may\u00a0be\u00a0done\nbefore\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0\u00a0completion\u00a0\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0\u00a0hearing\u00a0of\u00a0the\ninterlocutory\u00a0application - See Beese v. Woodhouse\n(1970) 1 W.L.R. 586, 590. An interim injunction is\nintended to be temporary in its character and any\nperson at whose suit such an injunction is obtained\nis under an obligation to limit, so far as possible,\nthe time during which it is operative. See Port way\nPress Ltd. v. Hague (1957) R.P.C. 426 at p. 429. In\nsuch a case, the Court makes an order to preserve\nthe status quo until the application for interlocutory\ninjunction can be heard and determined. The\nparamount objective being the doing of justice to\nthe parties, the court has a duty to preserve and\nprotect the right of the parties before it from\ndestruction by either of the parties where such a\nright is threatened by imminent danger from the\naction of the other. See Anton Piller KG v.\nManufacturing Processes (1976) 1 All E.R. 779. An\nex parte application is an application made without\nnotice to the party to be affected by the order to be\nmade. Order XXXIII Rule 7 which provides for\ninterlocutory applications to be made either ex\nparte, or after notice to the parties to be affected\nthereby, also provides that the court may refuse to\n79\nmake the order sought, or may grant an order to\nshow cause why the order should not be made, or\nmay allow the motion to be made on notice to the\nparties to be affected thereby - See Order XXXIII\nrule 10. I have already construed this rule in this\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n77/102\njudgment to mean that it does not envisage the\nmaking of an immediate absolute order. Such order\ncan be made on notice. Rules 11, 12 of Order\nXXXIII which provide for the varying or discharge\nof an ex parte order within seven days after service\nof it or within such further time as the court will\nallow seems to me to support this view.\nI agree\nwith the submission of Chief G. O. K. Ajayi, S.A.N.,\nthat an application for interlocutory injunction can\nbe made ex parte. But I do not agree that a court\ncan make such an order ex parte. I have already\ngiven my reasons for so holding, relying on my\ninterpretation of Order XXXIII rules 10, 11 of the\nFederal High Court Rules 1976. I think Professor A.\nB. Kasunmu, S.A.N., with whom Chief F. R. A.\nWilliams, S.A.N., agrees is right in his submission\nthat once the application is one \"until the final\ndetermination of the suit\" as was prayed for by the\nappellant in this case it is an interlocutory\ninjunction which ought not to be heard or granted\nex parte - See Ojukwu v. Governor of Lagos State\n& anor. (1986) 3 N. W.L.R. (Pt.26) 39 at p. 44.\nI would have agreed with Mr. Adio, counsel for the\nAttorney-General when he submitted that the\nappellant applied for an interlocutory order when\nwhat he actually needed was an interim order. So\nfar so good. But we parted ways when he went on\n80\nto submit that the learned Chief Judge was right to\nhave entertained the application and for \"cutting\nthe application to size in the way he made\nsubsequent five orders. . .\" This is another way of\nsaying that the court can grant to parties what they\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n78/102\nhave not asked for. This is clearly wrong. Where\nwhat applicant prays for is an interim injunction,\nthe order may be made until further order or a\nnamed date to enable the Respondent to be put on\nnotice. This is not so in the instant case. Chief\nOlowofoyeku, S.A.N., for the 3rd Respondent who\nhad not appealed against the judgment filed a brief\nurging that the appeal be allowed. Chief Williams,\nS.A.N., objected that Respondent having not cross-\nappealed was not entitled to attack the judgment.\nThe point was very well taken. It is a well settled\npractice of this Court that a Respondent seeking to\nset aside the judgment on other grounds is entitled\nto file a cross-appeal or a Respondent's notice - See\nOguma Associated Companies (Nig.) Ltd. v. I.B.\nW.A. Ltd. (1988) 1 N.W.L.R. (Pt.73) 658. We\naccording struck out the brief of argument which\nhas not complied with Order 8 Rule 3 of Rules of the\nSupreme Court 1985, Order 6 Rule 6.\nI now turn to the nature of the Order made and to the\nsubmission whether or not they are immediate\nabsolute orders or not. Chief G. O. K. Ajayi, S.A.\nN., conceded that there was only one application ex\nparte, and by its nature it was an application for an\ninterlocutory order, but submitted that the learned\nChief Judge on that application made an interim\norder on the 22nd April and adjourned to the 27th\n81\nApril, for hearing when the Respondents were to be\nheard. This submission was in line with Mr. Adio's\nsubmission.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n79/102\nAs against this argument both Professor Kasunmu\nfor the 1st Respondent and Chief Williams for the\n4th-8th Respondents pointed out that the orders\nwere made on the only ex parte motion before the\nlearned Chief Judge; that the first two orders made\nwere in the nature of absolute orders which\ngranted the prayers in the application, and that the\nremaining three orders were ancillary to the first\ntwo. Chief Williams took the view that the 4th\nOrder which adjourned the application, after it has\nbeen decided, to the 27th April, converted the\norder to an interim order, which he did not\nconcede, the order for hearing being fixed for the\n27th April, 1987 when the meeting was fixed for\nthe 25th was a spent order and offends against\nsection 33 of the Constitution 1979.\nThere is considerable force in the arguments of\nProfessor Kasunmu and Chief Williams. What, one\nmay ask, is an immediate absolute order? It is in\nmy opinion an order which is final as to the thing\nsought to be done without the interposition of any\nother order. There is no doubt that the 1st order\nwhich restrains the 1st and 2nd Defendants from in\nany way obstructing or frustrating the holding of\nthe Annual General Meeting of the 3rd\nDefendant/Respondent, WHENEVER IT IS FIXED is\nfinal and an absolute order not related to any time\nelement before the other side could be heard in\nrespect of that order. Similarly, the 2nd Order.\n82\nEven if it is conceded that there was an\nadjournment to the 27th April, what were the\nissues then left to be heard on that date? I am\nunable to discover any, although Chief Ajayi refers\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n80/102\nto the appointment of Directors. This is the issue to\nbe decided in the annual general meeting and was\nprohibited from discussion. The order made for\nservice of papers on the Respondents which were\nnot specified has not improved the situation. What\nOrder XXXIII Rule 10 requires in an ex parte\napplication is that the Court can refuse to make the\norder sought, or may grant an order to show cause\nwhy the order sought should not be made, or may\nallow the motion to be made on notice to the\nparties to be affected thereby. This is what the\nlearned Chief Judge should have done but failed to\ndo.\nIf he had refused to grant the application and made\nan order calling upon the Respondents to show\ncause why the orders should not be granted, or\ngiven them notice of the motion, the provisions of\nSection 33(1) of the Constitution 1979 as to the\nobligation of hearing the party to be affected before\ncoming to a definite and binding determination\nwould have been complied with. The right of the\nRespondents to be heard before the making of the\norders is clearly incontestable.\nThe effort of Chief G. O. K. Ajayi was directed as\nshowing that the crux of the dispute is the\nappointment of Directors. This is also an issue\nwhere the Respondents have a right to be heard.\nThe question whether or not the order made is\n83\nbeneficial to the parties is not a necessary\nprecondition to whether there has been a violation\nof the constitutional right to be heard before the\nmaking of a determination.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n81/102\nI think the Court of Appeal was right to hold that\nthe order to serve unspecified papers on the\nRespondents made as part of the ex parte orders\nwas tantamount to shutting the stable door after\nthe horse had bolted away. The criticism of that\nobservation by Chief Ajayi is unfair and wrong.\nChief G. O. K. Ajayi, S.A.N., referred to the\njudgment of the Court of Appeal that the affidavit\nof urgency contained no averments necessitating\nurgent hearing, and that the application ought to\nhave been dismissed on that ground alone. He\nsubmitted that the value of an affidavit of urgency\nwas to enable the court to exercise its discretion to\nhear the application. Once the application was\nheard the question of the value of the affidavit\nbecomes of very little, if any moment it is spent.\nThe\u00a0rationale\u00a0for\u00a0an\u00a0ex\u00a0parte\u00a0application\u00a0is\u00a0the\nprevention\u00a0\u00a0of\u00a0imminent\u00a0irretrievable\u00a0injury\u00a0or\ndamage\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0right\u00a0of\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0parties\u00a0to\u00a0the\nsuit.\nUrgency\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0necessary\u00a0fulcrum\u00a0on\u00a0which\u00a0the\napplication\u00a0rests.\u00a0However,\u00a0the\u00a0basis\u00a0of\u00a0granting\nthe\u00a0application\u00a0is\u00a0also\u00a0the\u00a0existence\u00a0of\u00a0special\ncircumstances\u00a0and\u00a0the\u00a0urgency\u00a0to\u00a0protect\u00a0the\ndestruction\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0right\u00a0involved\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0suit.\u00a0Thus\u00a0in\nthe\u00a0absence\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0real\u00a0urgency,\u00a0the\u00a0rationale\u00a0for\u00a0an\nex\u00a0parte\u00a0application\u00a0cannot\u00a0be\u00a0justified.\nIn the instant case, the Court of Appeal held that\n84\nno case of real urgency or any exceptional\ncircumstances was made out in the averment in the\naffidavit. Rather what was shown was an urgency\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n82/102\nprecipitated by the deliberate delay in bringing the\napplication. I entirely agree with this view.\nAppellant became aware of the letter containing the\ndirective from the 1st Respondent on the 14th\nApril. He knew that the meeting of the 3rd\nRespondent was for the 25th. He still did not bring\nthe application for the injunction to restrain the 1st\nRespondent until the 22nd April, 1987 leaving him\nwith only two days. There is no doubt on the facts\nthere was urgency in the application made on the\n22nd to restrain threatened interference with the\nproceedings of a meeting fixed for the 25th April.\nThis is undoubtedly a self induced urgency created\ndeliberately by the applicant, unrelated to the\nrealities of the antecedent events. This is not\nsufficient to support the application. It will be a\ndangerous precedent if the Court will shut its eyes\nto the obvious manipulation of events by an\napplicant to construct a situation not intended by\nthe principles sought to be invoked. Chief G. O. K.\nAjayi, S.A.N., criticized the Court of Appeal for\nholding that undertaking in damages was a\nnecessary condition to an order for an ex parte\ninjunction. He submitted that the Court of Appeal\nwas wrong to have held that even if the ex parte\norder of injunction made by the learned Chief\nJudge was not set aside on other grounds, it would\nhave been set aside for the failure of the appellant\nto give an undertaking as to damages. Where an\n85\nappellate court comes to the conclusion that such a\nnecessary undertaking had not been given, it is not\na proper ground to set aside the order. He cited in\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n83/102\nsupport, Smith v. Day (1882) 22 Ch. D. at p. 421;\nGraham v. Campbell (1877-1878) 7 Ch. D. 490 at\np. 494; Attorney-General v. Albany Hotel Coy\n(1896) 2 Ch. 696; Adamson v. Wilson (1864) 10\nL.T. 24; Chapel v. Davidson 44 E.R. 239.It was\nfinally submitted that the position which the Court\nof Appeal took in this case is the same as it did in\nUniversity of Lagos v. Olaniyan F.C.A./L/5/81, dated\n8/2/81 (Unreported) is erroneous.\nThe learned Senior Advocate seems to me to have\nmisconceived both the statement of the law and the\nratio of the cases he relied upon. The statement of\nthe position was stated clearly in Vol. 24 Halsburys\nLaws of England (4th Ed.) para. 1072. It was there\nstated that: \"An undertaking as to damages is the\nprice which the person asking for an interlocutory\ninjunction has to pay for it, and it ought to be\nrequired in every interlocutory order... By the\nundertaking the party obtaining the order\nundertakes to abide by an order as to damages\nwhich the court may make in case it should\nafterwards be of opinion that the Defendant has, by\nreason of the order sustained any damages which\nsuch party ought to pay.\" Chief Ajayi conceded that\nan undertaking as to damages ought to be given\nand was the rule, but argued that there were\nexceptions. The known exceptions do not seem to\nme relevant in this case.\nThe rationale for requiring an undertaking in\n86\ndamages to an order for interlocutory injunction is\nthat a failure to do so leaves the order without a\nsupporting consideration in the event of a discharge\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n84/102\nof the order. It is important particularly in an ex\nparte order made without hearing the party to be\naffected thereby. It is also necessary in order to\ncontrol any abuses of the provision. See Anton\nPiller KG. v. Manufacturing Processes (1976) 1 All\nE.R. 779\nChief Ajayi's final submission is that the Court of\nAppeal ought to be able to make the order for the\ngiving of the undertaking in damages where this is\nnecessary rather than set aside the order on the\ngrounds of the failure to give undertaking.\nIt does not appear that Chief Ajayi has fully\nappreciated the full effect of the ex parte order\nwhich aims at protecting threatened irreparable\ninjury.\nThus where no such injury properly so called, has\nbeen protected, the result is possible damage to the\nperson affected thereby against whom the order\nwas made without a hearing. The only salutary\norder in the Court of Appeal in the circumstances\nwhere the court of first instance failed to extract an\nundertaking as to damages will be to discharge the\norder made.\nFor the reasons I have given in this judgment, and\nfor the much fuller reasons given in the judgment\nof my learned brother, Nnaemeka-Agu, J.S. C., this\nappeal fails and is hereby dismissed.\nAppellant shall pay to the Respondents costs in this\nappeal assessed asfollows:\n87\n#500 in favour of the 1st Respondent.\n#500 in favour of the 4th-8th Respondents.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n85/102\nThere is no order as to costs to the 2nd and 3rd\nRespondents.\nABDUL GANIYI OLATUNJI AGBAJE, J.S.C. \u00a0: By a Writ of Summons dated 22nd April, 1987 the plaintiff, N. A. B. Kotoye, claimed against the Defendants, the Central Bank of\nNigeria and two others the following reliefs among others: A Declaration that the Plaintiff is entitled to remain in office as a Director of the 3rd Defendant Bank\nuntil he is removed from office in accordance with\nthe provisions of the Companies Act or the Articles\nof Association of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\nAn injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd\nDefendants from exercising any of their respective\npowers whether under the Banking Act or under\nthe Companies Act in such a way as to give effect\nto or provide sanctions against the plaintiff for\nfailure to give effect to any of the aforesaid\ndirectives of the 1st Defendant. An injunction\nrestraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants from in any\nway obstructing or frustrating the holding of the\nAnnual General Meeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank\nfor the purposes of electing new Directors or\neffecting any of the Statutory purposes of electing\nnew Directors or effecting any of the Statutory\npurposes for which Annual General Meetings are\nrequired to be held by the Companies Act 1968. On\nthe same day, i.e. 22nd April, 1987, the plaintiff\napplied by a motion ex- parte against the said\nDefendants for the following reliefs:\n88\n\"(i) Restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants, their\nservants and/or agents from in any way obstructing\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n86/102\nor frustrating the holding of the Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank until the final\ndetermination of this suit;\n(ii) For an order of injunction that until the\ndetermination of this suit the Defendants be\nrestrained from appointing or recognizing the\nappointment of any person or persons as Directors\nof the 3rd Defendant Company other than such of\nthem as are or may be duly appointed in\naccordance with the provisions of the Articles of\nAssociation of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\" Relevant\nto the motion ex parte or an injunction are the\nfollowing averments of the plaintiff in his affidavit\nin support of the application. First in the affidavit\nmarked \"Affidavit of Urgency\" there are the\nfollowing averments:\n\"2. That I am the Chairman of the Board of\nDirectors of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\n3. That Notice summoning the Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank for the 25th of\nApril, 1987 was issued on the 26th of March, 1987.\n4. That on the morning of Thursday the 16th of\nApril, 1987 I returned home a little after 12 noon\nand was shown a letter addressed to me by the 1st\nDefendant herein directing that the Nigerian\nDirectors of the 3rd Defendant Bank do meet\nurgently and to select its representatives on the\nBoard of the Bank and forward a list thereof to the\n1st Defendant within 10 days of the letter. The said\nletter is dated the 14th of April, 1987 and a copy of\n89\nthe same is already exhibited to the affidavit in\nsupport of the Notice filed herein.\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n87/102\n5. That the 1st Defendant has threatened in its\naforesaid letter that if the list of new Directors is\nnot supplied to it within 10 days of the said letter it\nwould take appropriate measures against the 3rd\nDefendant under the Banking Act.\nApart from the\nAffidavit of Urgency there is also another affidavit\nin support of the application. In that affidavit the\nplaintiff alleged that he was the Chairman of the\nBoard of Directors of the 3rd Defendant and he also\nwent on to allege his shareholding in the said bank.\nThe Motion ex parte was heard and determined by\nAnyaegbunam, C.J. as such on the same day it was\nfiled, i.e. 22nd April, 1987, and he made the\nfollowing orders in respect of it:\n\"After hearing G. O. K. Ajayi, S.A.N., and read all\nthe papers filed with the motion paper, I rule as\nfollows:\n(i) That 1st and 2nd Defendants/Respondents, their\nservants and agents should not in any way obstruct\nor frustrate the holding of the Annual General\nMeeting of 3rd Defendant/Respondent Bank\nwhenever it is fixed.\n(ii) That when the said Annual General Meeting is\nheld the ordinary affairs of the 3rd\nDefendant/Respondent Bank should be discussed.\n(iii) That no new Directors will be appointed, the\nold Directors should continue to function until the\ndetermination of this Application or the Court\notherwise orders.\n(iv) I hereby also order that 1st, 2nd and 3rd\n90\nDefendants/Respondents be served with all the\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n88/102\nmotion papers. This will enable them file whatever\npaper they wish to. Adjourned Application to\nMonday, 27/4/87, at 1 p.m.\"\nThe Defendants appealed successfully against the\norder of Anyaegbunam, C.J. to the Court of Appeal,\nLagos division. That court Coram Akpata, Awogu,\nKalgo, JJ.C.A. set aside the orders of\nAnyaegbunam, C.J. in their place the following\norder was made:\n\"The orders of Anyaegbunam made in F.H.G./L\n/35/87 on April 22, 1987 are hereby set aside and\ndeclared null and void. The suit is remitted to the\nFederal High Court for continuation before another\nJudge.\"\nIt is pertinent to add here that after the motion ex\nparte was heard and determined in the Federal\nHigh Court, Alhaji Ibrahim Dabo & 4 ors were\nadded as Defendants to the case before the appeal\nin the Court of Appeal was taken.\nThe plaintiff being dissatisfied with the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeal, has now appealed against it to\nthis court.\nBriefs of arguments were filed on all sides. It\nappears to me that the issues really for\ndetermination in this appeal has been concisely and\ncorrectly set down in the Brief of Argument filed on\nbehalf of the 4th to the 8th Defendants, who as I\nhave said were joined after the orders on the\nmotion ex parte were made. The questions for\ndetermination were stated as follows:\n\"(i) Whether the High Court had jurisdiction to\n91\nentertain the motion ex parte or, indeed, the claims\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n89/102\nrelevant to that motion.\n(ii) If, but only if the answer to Question (i) is in\nthe negative\n(a) Whether the court below was correct in deciding\nthat the Federal High Court ought not to have\nentertained the plaintiff's application\n(b) Whether the court below was correct in saying\nthat there were no exceptional circumstances to\njustify the grant of interlocutory injunctions by ex\nparte orders in this case and\n(c) Whether the court was correct in setting aside\nthe order on the ground also that the plaintiff gave\nno undertaking as to damages in respect of the\ninjunction.\"\nI have stated earlier on in this judgment the claims\nof the plaintiff is so far as they are relevant to the\nissues about to be considered in this appeal. I have\nalso stated the relevant facts too. It only remains\nto me to state the relevant rules of the Federal\nHigh Court which to me are as follows:\nOrder 20 dealing with the injunction generally and\nOrder 33 dealing with interlocutory applications\ngenerally. As regards Order 20, I need only refer to\nRules 1 and 5 therein\n\"1. In any suit in which it is shown to the\nsatisfaction of the court that any property which is\nin dispute in the suit is in danger of being wasted,\ndamaged, or alienated by any party to the suit, it\nshall be lawful for the court to issue an injunction\nto such party, commanding him to refrain from\ndoing the particular act complained of, or to give\n92\nsuch other order for the purpose of staying and\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n90/102\npreventing him from wasting, damaging or\nalienating the property, as to the court may see fit, and in\nall cases in which it may appear to the court to be\nnecessary for the preservation, or the better\nmanagement or custody of any property which is in\ndispute in a suit, it shall be lawful for the court to\nappoint a receiver or manager of such property,\nand if need be to remove the person in whose\npossession or custody the property may be from the\npossession or custody thereof, and to commit the\nsame to the custody of such receiver or manager,\nand to grant to such receiver or manager all such\npowers for the management or the preservation\nand improvement of the property, and the\ncollection of the rents and profits thereof, and the\napplication and disposal of such rents and profits,\nas to the court may seem proper.\n5. The court may, in every case, before granting an\ninjunction or order as aforesaid, direct such\nreasonable notice of the application for the same to\nbe given to the opposite party as it may see fit.\"\nWith respect to Order 33, I need only refer for the\npurpose of this appeal to Rules 1, 7, 8, and 10:\n\"1. Interlocutory applications may be made by\nmotion at any stage of a cause or matter.\n7. Motions may be made either ex parte or after\nnotice to the parties to be affected thereby.\n8. On a motion ex parte the party moving shall\napply for either an immediate absolute order of the\ncourt, in the terms of the motion paper, on his own\n93\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n91/102\nshowing evidence, or an order on the other party to\nappear on a certain day and show cause why an\norder should not be made in terms of the motion\npaper.\n10. Where a motion is made ex parte, the court\nmay refuse to make the order sought, or may grant\nan order to show cause why the order sought\nshould not be made, or may allow the motion to be\nmade on notice to the parties to be affected\nthereby.\"\nIn this connection I must reproduce the provision of\nSection 6(6)( a) which says:\n(6) The judicial powers vested in accordance with\nthe foregoing provisions of this Section\n(a) shall extend, notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in this Constitution, to all inherent powers\nand sanctions of a court of law.\"\nI am satisfied that the combined effect of the\nRule 1 of Order 20 and rules 1, 7, 8 and 10 of Order\n33 of the Federal High Court Rules is that an\napplication ex parte for an injunction can be made\nto the Federal High Court. At this stage it may be\nnecessary to consider the implication of an\ninterlocutory injunction. The remedy by\ninterlocutory injunction is usually to obtain the\nprotection of the court by an interim order in terms\nof the injunction claimed by the writ or even when\nsuch an injunction is not claimed. Such an\napplication for interlocutory injunction may be\nmade on motion or by motion ex parte and I have\njust said that the provisions of the rules I have\nreferred to above would enable the plaintiff to\n94\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n92/102\napply for an interlocutory injunction by a motion ex\nparte. However, the principles governing the\nconsideration of such an ex parte application are\nwell settled.\nEx parte injunctions are for cases of real urgency\nwhere there has been a true impossibility of giving\nnotice of motion and such an injunction will be\nrefused unless the plaintiff has an overwhelming\ncase on the merit, on the ground that the delay in\nmaking the application has been insufficiently\nexplained. [See Bates v. Lord Hailsham of St.\nMarylebone (1972) 1 W.L.R. 1373; (972) 3 All E.R.\n1019]. Again an injunction will be granted ex parte\nonly in cases of emergency e.g. where property is\nin danger of being lost or de s[See Brand v. Mitson\n(1876) 24 W.R. 524; and see London & County\nBanking Co. v. Lewis (1882) 21 Ch. D 490; Evans\nv. Puleston (1880) W.N. 127; Fenwick v. E. London\nRy (1875) L.R. 20 Esq, p. 547)] and even where\nthe ex parte injunction is granted it should\ngenerally be until a certain day usually the next\nmotion day. (Ex p. Abrams (1884) 50 L.T. 184) by\nwhich time the other side should have been put on\nnotice. An undertaking by the plaintiffs as to\ndamages ought to be given on every interlocutory\ninjunction though not where the order is in the\nnature of a final order. See Fenner v. Wilson\n(1893) 2 Ch. 656, and (except under special\ncircumstances) effect ought to be given to it (per\nJames LJ., Graham v. Campbell (1877-1878) 7 Ch.\nD 490, and see Mem by Jessel, M.R. in (1879) W.N.\n74; Newcomen v. Coulson (1877-1878) 7 Ch. D.\n95\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n93/102\n764; Seton. 509, 511).\nThe point has been made\nthat because of Section 33(1) of the Constitution of\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria 1979, which\nprovides for a right to fair hearing and, most\npresumably too because of the maxim audi alteram\npartem, will be unconstitutional to entertain a\nmotion ex parte for an injunction which may\nnecessarily entail making an Order against another\nwithout hearing him. It is because of this point that\nI have earlier on referred to Section 6(6)( a) of\n1979 Constitution which reserves for all the courts\nestablished by the Constitution all inherent powers\nand sanctions of the court of law notwithstanding\nanything to the contrary in the Constitution. The\ngranting of an ex parte application for an injunction\nin cases of urgency and emergency is one of the\ninherent powers of a court of law for the\nenhancement of the administration of justice. So\nfor my part I see nothing unconstitutional in the\ntaking of such an application within the safe guards\nsurrounding it.\nNow reverting to the application in hand, which is a\nmotion ex parte for an interlocutory injunction, I\nam in complete agreement with the lower court\nthat there was no real urgency for the application\nin the sense that there had been a true\nimpossibility of giving notice of the motion to the\nother side. Again I am in agreement with the lower\ncourt that the learned trial Judge, Anyaegbunam,\nC.J., although he gave some indication of the need\nto give a hearing to the Defendants before\nconcluding the hearing on the ex parte application\n96\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n94/102\nbefore him, yet he had by then virtually made what\nwould amount to absolute orders on the ex parte\napplication. So there was virtually nothing left to\nbe considered again when the ex parte application\nwould come on again as a motion on notice for\nhearing.\nI am satisfied too that the Court of Appeal was\nwrong in setting aside the orders of the trial Court\nin one breath and in another breath declaring them\nnull and void. The proper order to make in the\ninstant case was one setting aside the order\nsimpliciter. And the consequential order to that\nshould be one striking out the ex parte application\nas being incompetent.\nIt is for the above reasons and the fuller reasons\ngiven in the lead judgment of my learned brother,\nNnaemeka-Agu, J.S.C. which I have had the\nopportunity of reading in draft that I too will\ndismiss the appeal of the plaintiff and allow the\ncross appeal of the 4th-8th Defendants in this\nappeal. I abide by all the consequential orders in\nthe lead judgment including the orders as to costs.\nEBENEZER BABASANYA CRAIG, J.S.C. : I have read in advance the judgment of my learned\nbrother, Nnaemeka-Agu, J.S.C., and I agree entirely\nwith the views expressed and the conclusions reached. I too am of the view that the appeal should be dismissed.\nThe principal issue on this appeal is whether a\nCourt can make an order affecting the interests of\nthe party on an ex parte Motion. see Rex v. Sussex\nGenerally speaking, the principle of natural justice\n97\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n95/102\ndictates that the Court should hear both parties\nbefore making binding orders on either of them;\nJustices, ex parte McCarthy ( 1924) 1 K. NB. 256.\nThis principle has now been entrenched in our\nConstitution (Sec. 33 of the 1979\nConstitution) and has since then become the\ncornerstone of our case law. See\nGarba v. University of Maiduguri (1986) 1 N.W.L.R.\n(Pt.18) 550; Prof D. Olatubosun v. N. S. E. R . (1983) 3 N.\nW. L. R. (Pt.80) 25; Busari Akande v. The State ex\nparte Governor of Oyo State and Anor .(1988) 3 N.\nW. L. R.(Pt.85) 681.\nHowever, the Law permits that, in exceptional\ncases, the Court may issue an interim injunction,\nbefore hearing the other party. But such orders\nshould be made only in cases of extreme urgency\nwhere for instance, there is imminent danger to the\nsubject-matter of the suit, and it is impossible to\ngive notice to the other side. Re: Anon (1876) W.N.\n12.\nIn any case, such an order should be for a period of\nlimited duration, say a few hours or for a day or\ntwo - pending service of the motion on the other\nside. This is in recognition of the legal rights of the\nother to be heard before any order affecting his\ninterests is made.\nAfter hearing both parties, the Court may either\nconfirm the interim order or discharge it, or make\nsuch order or orders as the justice of the case\ndemands.\nIt is important to note that beyond the strict limits\nstated above, it would be wrong to make orders on\n98\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n96/102\nan ex parte application which would permanently\naffect the interest of a party who has not been\nheard.\nIn the instant appeal, the appellant had sued the\nRespondent in the Federal High Court, Lagos\nclaiming a total of 9 relief's. The three reliefs which\nare relevant to this appeal are for:\n\"(ii) A Declaration that the directive given by the\n1st Defendant in the said letter that all shares\nacquired by the plaintiff in the 3rd Defendant since\n1982 be divested to other Nigerians is ultra vires\nthe 1st Defendant.\n(viii) An injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd\nDefendants from exercising any of their respective\npowers where under the Banking Act or under the\nCompanies Act in such a way as to give effect to or\nprovide sanctions against the plaintiff for failure to\ngive effect to any of the aforesaid directives of the\n1st Defendant.\n(ix) An Injunction restraining the 1st and 2nd\nDefendants from in any way obstructing or\nfrustrating the holding of the Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank for the\npurposes of electing new Directors or affecting any\nof the Statutory purposes for which Annual General\nMeetings are required to be held by the Companies\nAct 1968. \"\nThat Writ was filed on 22nd April, 1987, and on the\nsame day, the appellant also filed an ex parte\nmotion in which he asked for an order:\n\"(i) Restraining the 1st and 2nd Defendants, their\nservants and/or agents from in any way obstructing\n99\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n97/102\nor frustrating the holding of the Annual General\nMeeting of the 3rd Defendant Bank until the final\ndetermination of this suit;\n(ii) for an order of injunction that until the\ndetermination of this suit the Defendants be\nrestrained from appointing or recognising the\nappointment of the 3rd Defendant Company other\nthan such of them as are or may be duly appointed\nin accordance with the provisions of the Articles of\nAssociation of the 3rd Defendant Bank.\"\nIt would be seen that the two prayers which the\nappellant had asked for are substantially the same\nas claims (vii) and (ix) on his writ. The Motion was\nverified by an affidavit of 18 pages and attached to\nit, were the following voluminous documents:\n(a) The Writ of Summons\n(b) The proposed Statement of Claim (26\nparagraphs)\n(c) Memorandum and Articles of Association of\nSociete-Generale Bank(Nig.)

(42 pages)\n(d) 1st Defendant's letter dated 14/4/87 (10 pages)\nUpon an affidavit of urgency filed on the same day\n(22/4/87), the learned Chief Judge, of the Federal\nHigh Court, heard the application and granted all\nthe prayers. He made the following orders:\n\"After hearing G. O. K.

That Court\n(per Awogu J. C.A.) held that the appellant's\naffidavit did not disclose any situation of urgency or\nother exceptional circumstances and was of the\nview that the prayers ought not to have been granted\nThe orders were therefore set aside. There has\nbeen a further appeal to this Court and I have\nalready indicated that I share the views contained\nin the judgment of my learned brother,\nNnaemeka-Agu, J.S.C. I only wish to make a few\ncomments of my own.\nFrom the voluminous papers attached to the\nappellant's ex parte motion, the prayers asked for\n101\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n99/102\nseemed to me to be of a highly contentious nature,\nand those papers should not have been granted\nwithout hearing both parties.\nSecondly, I have already pointed out that the two\nprayers on the Motion were substantially the same\nas the claims in the suit. It seems to me therefore\nthat to grant the motion might mean that the court\nhad given judgment on those two claims based\nsolely on mere affidavit evidence, and without\nserving the other parties to the suit. This is not\nright.\nLastly, in his two prayers, the appellant had asked\nthe trial Court for an Injunction:\n(a) Restraining the Respondents from obstructing\nor frustrating the holding of an Arrival General\nMeeting \"until the final determination of the suit\"\n(b) Restraining the Defendants from appointing or\nrecognising any persons as Directors of the 3rd\nDefendant/Bank until the determination of the suit.\nThe trial Court granted the prayers but it seems to\nthe trial Court granted the prayers but it seems to\nme in terms wider than the appellant had asked\nfor. The Court restrained the Respondent in the 1st\nprayer from obstructing.\n\"the holding of the Annual General Meeting of\nthe 3rd Defendant/Respondent Bank whenever it is\nheld.\"\nThat order is quite different from what has been\nasked. The phrase \"whenever it is held\" seems to\nme too wide for the type of interim order which\nshould have been made on an ex parte Motion. If a\ntime limit has to be fixed, it should be for the\n102\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n100/102\nshortest possible period pending service on the\nRespondent. Furthermore, the learned Chief Judge\nmade further orders of a rather far-reaching\nnature, which were capable of substantially\naffecting the legal rights of a party who was not\nbefore the Court and who has not been heard. The\nChief Judge ordered that:\n\"when the said Annual General Meeting is held the\nordinary affairs of the 3rd Defendant/Respondent\nBank should be discussed.\"\nI think that this and the other orders were wrongly\nmade and I agree that the Court of Appeal was\nright to set aside those orders.\nFor the fuller reasons set out in the lead judgment,\nwith which I agree, I am of the view that the appeal\nfails and it is accordingly dismissed. I make the\nsame orders as to costs as contained in the\njudgment of my learned brother, Nnaemeka-Agu,\nJ.S.C.\nAppeal Dismissed.\nCross-Appeal Allowed.\n103\n5/8/25, 11:22 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n101/102\nChief G.

There is miscarriage of justice only where there are substantial errors in adjudication. With\nthe resultant effect that the party relying on such errors may likely have a judgment in his favour.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - LITERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION - Approach of Court in interpreting the clear and unambiguous words of a\nstatute\n\"It is common ground that where the words of the provisions of a statute are clear and unambiguous, they should be given their plain, ordinary, grammatical\nmeaning, without qualification.\"\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - RIGHT OF ACCESS TO COURT - Attitude of Court to statutory provisions limiting a citizen's right of access to Court\n\"... a legitimate regulation of access to Courts should not be directed at impeding ready access to the Courts. There is no provision in the Constitution for\nspecial privileges to any class or category of persons. Any statutory provision aimed at the protection of any class of persons from the exercise of the\nCourt of its constitutional jurisdiction to determine the right of another citizen seems to me inconsistent with the provisions of Section 6(6)(b) of the\nConstitution ...\"\nWORDS AND PHRASES - \"ACCESS TO COURT\" - Meaning of the phrase \"access to court\"\n\"Access to the Court means approach or means of approach to the Court without constraint.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - SECTION 11 OF THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION ACT, 1977 - Interpretation of Section 11 of the\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act, 1977 as regards the mandatory requirement for the service of notice upon the Corporation of\nintention to commence an action against them and the content of such notice\n\"Section 11(2) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act, 1977 provides as follows - \"No suit shall be commenced against the Corporation before\nthe expiration of a period of one month after written notice of intention to commence the suit shall have been served upon the Corporation by the\nintending plaintiff or his agent; and the notice shall clearly and explicitly state the cause of action, the particulars of the claim, the name and place of abode\nof the intending plaintiff and the relief which he claims.\" It seems quite clear on analysis of the above Section and from the use of the expression \"shall\"\ntherein, that the Sub-section makes it mandatory to give notice to the Corporation, and that no suit shall be commenced before the expiration of one\nmonth, after written notice of intention to commence the suit shall have been served upon the Corporation by the intending plaintiff or his agent. This first\npart is very wide and the opening phrase \"No suit shall be commenced\" prohibits the commencement of all suits whatsoever. This was the decision of this\nCourt in Fawehinmi Construction Co. Ltd. v. Obafemi Awolowo University (1998)6NWLR (Pt.553) 171 , where the provisions of Section 46(1) University of Ife\nEdict, in pari materia with Section 11(2) of the NNPC Act, 1977 was so construed. It also provides that the suit shall have been served upon the Corporation\nby the intending plaintiff or his agent. Thus, the question of service of notice shall be made upon the Corporation by the plaintiff or his agent. The second\npart which uses the same imperative expression \"shall\" prescribes the content of the notice required in the first part. The notice shall clearly and explicitly\nstate (a) the cause of action (b) particulars of claim, (c) the name and place of abode of the intending plaintiff (d) the relief claimed. It seems to me\ntherefore that the requirement of the service of notice upon the Corporation of intention to commence a suit against them which shall be made by the\nintending plaintiff or his agent is mandatory, but the contents of the notice are directory statutory requirements - See Katsina Local Authority v. Makudawa\n(1971) 1NMLR 100 at 105-7; Umukoro v. NPA (1997) 4 NWLR (pt.502) 656.\"\nACTION - PRE-ACTION NOTICE - Extent of applicability of pre-action notice prescribed by Section 11(2) Nigerian National Petroleum\nCorporation Act\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/61\n\"I should state that the ipsissima verba of Section 11(2) affords absolute protection to the Corporation - See Fawehinmi Construction Co. Ltd. v. O.A.U. (1998)\n6 NWLR (Pt.553) 171. The expression \"No Suit\" in Section 11(2) NNPC Act. 1977, has been construed in Section 46(1) of the University of Ife Edict as wide and\nall embracing. It was construed as covering all suits and whatever causes of action and not limited to anything done pursuant to any Act or Statute. It\nrelates to all or any type of action. It is wider and different in application from Section 97 of the Ports Authority Act. - See NPA v. Construzioni Generali\n(1974) 12 SC 81; Katsina Local Authority v. Makudawa (1971) 1NMLR 100.\"\nACTION - CONDITION PRECEDENT - Meaning and nature of condition precedent\n\"Cases constantly occur in which, although everything has happened which would at Common Law, prima facie entitle a man to a certain sum of money, or\nvest in him a certain right of action, there is yet something more which must happen, in the particular case, before he is entitled to sue, either by reason of\nthe provision of some statute or because the parties have expressly so agreed. This is something called a condition precedent. It is not of the essence of\nsuch a cause of action, but it is essential. It is an additional formality super-imposed on the law. See Prince J.S. Atolagbe & Anor. v. Alhaji Ahmadu Awuni & 2\nOrs. (1997) 9 NWLR G (Pt. 522) 536 at 566 and English Supreme Court Practice (White Book) 1991 Edition Order 18/7/10. This Court had held in Atolagbe v.\nAwuni (supra) that the Kwara State Edict No.3 of 1988 which directed for payment of N10,000.00 as a condition precedent to instituting an action in\nchieftaincy matters in Kwara State is not contrary to the provisions of Section 6(6)(b) of 1979 Constitution.\"\nWORDS AND PHRASES - \"MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE\" - Meaning of \"miscarriage of justice\"\n\"I shall rely on the definition of \"miscarriage of justice\" by Lord Thankerton in the Privy Council decision of Devi v. Roy (1946) AC. 508, where his Lordship said\nthat it is: \"... such a departure from the rules which permeate all judicial procedure as to make that which happened not in the proper sense of the word\njudicial procedure at all.\" Again, in the United States decision of Alcorn v. Davies 343 P. 2d. 621, 625-6, Vandyke P.1, adopted the test applied in People v.\nWatson 292, P2d, 243 where it was said; \"... A miscarriage of justice should be declared only when the Court, after an examination of the entire case,\nincluding the evidence, is of the opinion that it is reasonably probable that a result more favourable to the appealing party would have been reached in the\nabsence of the error.\"\nACTION - CONDITION PRECEDENT - Whether condition precedent is a contradiction to the constitutional right of access to Court\n\"The provision of Section 36(1) undoubtedly couched in wide absolute terms and is not unqualified. The purport of the provision is to enable right of access\nto the Court absent legal obstacles in his path neutralising exercise of the right. The constitutional right of access to the Court does not however preclude\nstatutory regulations of the exercise of the right. It is however, not consistent with the exercise of the right of access to Court to make regulations which\nsubvert the exercise of the right or render the right nugatory - See Bakare v. AG of the Federation (1990) 5 NWLR (Pt.152) 516. Courts guard the words of\nstatutory provisions depriving them of the exercise of their constitutional jurisdiction jealously. Hence, the language of such provisions will be watched and\nwill not be extended beyond their least onerous meaning. See Sode v. AG Federation & Ors. (1986) 2 NWLR (Pt.24) 586 . Regulations of the right to access to\nthe Court abound in the rules of procedure and are legitimate. It seems to be accepted that where an enactment regulates the right of access to the Court\nin a manner to constitute an improper obstacle to access to Court, such enactment could be appropriately regarded as an infringement of Section 36(1)\nrather than an infringement of Section 6 of the Constitution. I have already referred to the provisions of Section 11(2) of theNNPC Act, 1977. I have also\nanalysed the provisions as between the first part relating to giving of the notice to the Corporation of the intention to bring the suit against it and the\nsecond part which prescribes the content of the notice. Although, it would seem that the provision regulates the commencement of actions against the\nCorporation without removing the adjudicatory powers of the Court in respect of matters concerning the Corporation or denying the individual totally of\nthe exercise of his right to Court. These are legitimate purposes of pre-action notice and are recognised procedure provisions. As was stated in Ngelegla v.\nTribal authority, Nongowa Chiefdom (1953) 14WACA 325 at 327, such provisions are to give the defendant \"breathing time so as to enable him to determine\nwhether he should make reparation to the plaintiff.\" In the recent decision of this Court in Atolagbe v.Awuni (1997) 9 NWLR (Pt.522) 536 , a split decision of\n5:2 held that Section 15 of the Chiefs(Appointment and Deposition) Law of Kwara State,as amended by Edict No.3 of 1988 which provided that a condition\nprecedent to the payment of a non-refundable fee of N10,000 to the Accountant- General of the State to the institution of an action by a person\naggrieved by a decision of the Governor or other appointing authority in a chieftaincy matter where an appointment has been made, is not inconsistent\nwith the provisions of Section 6(6)(b). It was held that Section 15 of Edict No.3 of 1988 did not curtail the right of a person to sue in a chieftaincy matter. It is\nmerely a condition precedent which must be fulfilled before an action can be instituted. This and similar decisions of this Court which have held that a pre-\naction notice is not inconsistent with Section 6(6) (b) of the Constitution should not be taken to mean that in certain circumstances, the particular\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n4/61\nrequirement can never constitute infringement of the exercise of judicial powers by the Courts or abridge the citizen's right of access to the Court. Such\nlast mentioned situations will definitely be inconsistent with the Constitution.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - SECTION 11 OF THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION ACT, 1977 - Interpretation of Section 11 of the\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act, 1977 as regards whether the word \"shall\" was used in a mandatory sense or directory sense\n\"Section 11 of the 1977 Act is in two parts. It provides - \"11(1) Notwithstanding anything in any other enactment, no suit against the Corporation, a member of\nthe Board or any employee of the Corporation for any act done in pursuance or execution of any enactment or law, or of any public duties or authority, or in\nrespect of any alleged neglect or default in the execution of such enactment or law, or of any public duties or authority, shall lie or be instituted in any\nCourt unless it is commenced within twelve months next after the act, neglect or default complained of or, in the case of a continuance of damage or\ninjury, within twelve months next after the ceasing thereof. (2) No suit shall be commenced against the Corporation before the expiration of a period of one\nmonth after written notice of intention to commence the suit shall have been served upon the Corporation by the intending plaintiff or his agent and the\nnotice shall clearly and explicitly state the cause of action, the particulars of the claim, the name and place of abode of the intending plaintiff and the relief\nwhich he claims.\" While Subsection (1) deals with the limitation of the time within which an action could be commenced against the Corporation,\nSubsection (2) provides that one month notice of intention to sue must be given to the Corporation before the action is commenced. In the present case,\nwe are only concerned with the provisions of Subsection (2) upon which the defendant relied in bringing the motion in the High Court for the plaintiff's\naction to be struck out for want of jurisdiction. The word \"shall\" as underlined above, appears three times in Subsection (2). It is settled that the word \"shall\",\nwhen used in an enactment is capable of bearing many meanings. It may be implying futurity or implying a mandate or direction or giving permission - See\nIfezue v. Mbadugha, (1984) 1 SCNLR 427 at Pp. 456 - 7. In the present case, we are concerned with whether it has been used in a mandatory sense or\ndirectory sense. If used in a mandatory sense, then the action to be taken must obey or fulfill the mandate exactly; but if used in a directory sense then the\naction to be taken is to obey or fulfill the directive substantially - See Woodward v. Sarsons (1875) L.R. 10 C.P. 733 at p. 746; Pope v. Clarke (1953) 1WLR 1060;\nJulius v. Lord Bishop of Oxford (1880) 5 A.C. (H.L.) 214 at Pp. 222 and 235 and State v. Ilori (1983) 1 SCNLR 94 at P.110. In Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner\n(1861) 30 L.J. Ch. 379 at P. 657 it was held - \"No universal rule can be laid down for the construction of statutes as to whether mandatory enactments shall\nbe considered directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for disobedience. It is the duty of Courts of justice to try and get at the real intention\nof the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be construed.\" It appears to me that the first \"shall\" in Subsection (2) imports\nobligation. No suit could be commenced against the Corporation until a period of one month expires after giving a prescribed notice. The second \"shall\"\nseems to me to import obligation also. Before suing the Corporation a notice of intention to commence the suit must be given to the Corporation. However,\nI am of the opinion that the third \"shall\" connotes direction in the sense in which it is used. It describes the particulars to be contained in the notice of\nintention to sue. While the issuance of the notice by a prospective plaintiff is mandatory, the particulars to be included in the notice, which are cause of\naction, particulars of claim, name and place of abode of the intending plaintiff and the relief to be claimed appear to me to be directory. As was held by this\nCourt per Coker, J.S.C. in the case of Katsina Local Government v. Makudawa (1971) I NMLR 100 at 107, the purpose of giving notice of claim to the Local\nGovernment of the claim against it is that it is not taken by surprise but to have adequate time to prepare to deal with the claim in its defence. The purpose\nof the notice \"is not to put hazards in the way of bringing litigation against it. Furthermore Section 23 of the Interpretation Act, 1964 (now Cap. 192 of the\nLaws of the Federation of Nigeria, 1990) provides:- \"23. Where a form is prescribed by an enactment, a form which differs from the prescribed form shall\nnot be invalid for the purposes of the enactment by reason only of the difference if the difference is not in a material particular and is not calculated to\nmislead.\"\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - ISSUE OF JURISDICTION - When an objection to the jurisdiction of Court can be raised\n\"... any challenge to jurisdiction, being fundamental, could be raised at any time and in this Court even if not raised in the lower Courts.\"\nJUDGEMENT SUMMARY\nINTRODUCTION:\nThis appeal borders on Civil Procedure.\nFACTS:\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n5/61\nThis is an appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal which affirmed\u00a0the High Court's ruling striking out the appellant's suit for failure to comply with\u00a0a\ncondition precedent.\u00a0Appellant was in full time, permanent and pensionable employment of the respondent's Corporation. On the 16th July, 1985, respondent wrote to\nhim in a letter suspending him from the employment on half-pay during the period of\u00a0suspension. In another letter dated 31st December, 1986 he was dismissed with\neffect from 31st December, 1985.\u00a0Appellant thereafter filed a suit against the respondent for a declaration that his purported suspension and subsequent dismissal\nwere wrongful, illegal, null and void and of no effect. He sought for an order restraining the defendant, their servants, agents and/or privies from preventing him from\ncontinuing his job as Head of Operations/Technical Department. Both parties filed their pleadings. Defendants then filed a Motion to strike out the suit for want of\njurisdiction. The defendant's motion came up for hearing. After argument, the learned trial Judge held that he had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit on the ground\nthat Exhibit \"B\" was not in compliance with the notice prescribed in Section 11(2) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act 1977 and struck out the\nclaim.\u00a0Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal on two grounds of appeal challenging the interpretation of Section 11(2) of the NNPC Act 1977 by the learned trial\nJudge. After hearing arguments of the parties and considering their briefs of argument, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Dissatisfied with the decision of the\nCourt of Appeal the Appellant appealed further to the Supreme Court challenging the decision of the Court of Appeal.\nISSUES:\nThe Appellant distilled four issues for determination:\n(a) Whether or not Exhibit 'B' (i.e. letter of demand from appellant's Solicitors) is a valid notice within the meaning and intendment of the N.N.P.C. Act, 1977.\n(b) Even if Exhibit 'B' is not a valid notice (which is denied), whether or not such privileges as conferred by Section 11(2) of the N.N.P.C. Act, 1977 extend to suits for\nbreach of contracts of employment such as in the instant case.\n(c) Whether or not the Court of Appeal judges (sic) have occasioned injustice to the appellant when they failed to appreciate the need for them to be guided by the\nissues raised for determination before them and therefore failed to appreciate the\ncase before them properly and/or failed to invoke the provisions of Section 6 of the 1979 Constitution.\n(d) Whether or not the respondents knew or could have known the appellant's place of abode as at the time of Exhibit 'B'.\nThe respondent raised three issues for determination:\n(a) Whether Exhibit B (the letter of demand from the appellant's Solicitors to the respondent) is a valid Notice within the provisions of Section 11(2) of the N.N.P.C. Act.\n(b) Did the appellant suffer any 'miscarriage of justice' because the Court of Appeal failed to pronounce on whether the Notice contemplated by Section 11(2) of the\nN.N.P.C. Act applies to suits for breach of contract of employment.\n(c) Whether lack of knowledge of the appellant's place of abode was the basis for the decision of the Court of Appeal.\nDECISION/HELD:\nIn the final analysis,\u00a0the Supreme Court in a unanimous decision allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the High Court for trial by another Judge.\nMUHAMMADU LAWAL UWAIS, J.S.C. (Delivering the Leading\u00a0Judgment): This is an interlocutory appeal. The\nappellant was plaintiff in the High Court of Lagos\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n6/61\nState, where he instituted a suit against the\nrespondent as defendant claiming as follows:-\n\"(i) A declaration that his purported suspension and\nsubsequent dismissal are wrongful, illegal, null,\nvoid and of no effect.\n(ii) An order that the plaintiff is still the Head of\nOperations/Technical Department.\n(iii) An order restraining the defendant, their\nservants, agents and/or privies from preventing the\nplaintiff from continuing his job as Head of\nOperations/Technical Department.\n(iv) N18,700.00 (Eighteen Thousand, Seven\nHundred Naira) being arrears of salaries from July,\n1985 to April, 1987 at the rate of N850.00 (Eight\n6\nHundred and\u00a0Fifty Naira) per month and thereafter\nat the same rate of N850.00 (Eight\u00a0Hundred and\nFifty Naira) until judgment.\nALTERNATIVELY\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n7/61\n(v) N1,000,000.00 (One Million Naira) being special\nand general damages for unlawful, irregular and\nmalicious determination of the plaintiff's\nemployment and/or breach of plaintiff's contract of\nservice with the defendants.\"\nPleadings were filed and exchanged. As part of its\ndefence, the defendant averred as follows in\nparagraphs 33 and 34 of its Statement of Defence:-\n\"33. The defendant would at the hearing of this suit\nraise the issue of law that the\u00a0Court has no\njurisdiction to hear this matter in view of the\nprovisions of\u00a0Section 3(3) of the Civil Service\nCommissions and Other Statutory Bodies (Removal\nof Certain Persons from Office) Decree No. 16 of\n1984.\n34. The defendant would also at the hearing of this\nsuit raise the issue of law that the suit is\nincompetent for the plaintiff's failure to comply with\nthe provisions of Sec. 11(2) of the Nigerian National\nPetroleum Corporation Act 1977 in that no written\nnotice of his Intention to commence this suit\nwherein the cause of action, particulars of claim,\nrelief claimed and place of abode of the plaintiff\nshould have been stated was served by the plaintiff\non the defendant. Whereupon the defendant\ncontends that the plaintiff's claim is frivolous and\nmisconceived and should be dismissed with cost.\"\nThis was followed by a motion on notice by the\n7\ndefendant praying the High Court to strike out the\nsuit for want of jurisdiction. The motion was heard\nby Silva, J. on the 15th day of April, 1988. In a\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/61\nconsidered ruling delivered on the 20th day of\nJune, 1988, the learned judge upheld the\npreliminary objection raised by the defendant and\nstruck out the suit for lack of jurisdiction.\nDissatisfied with the ruling, the plaintiff appealed to\nthe Court of Appeal. His appeal was dismissed by\nthe Court (Ademola, J.C.A., Babalakin, J.C.A., as he\nthen was, and Awogu, J.C.A.). In doing so, the\nCourt stated thus, Per Awogu, J.C.A. who wrote the\nlead judgment - which was supported by other\nmembers of the panel)\n\" ... in the instant appeal, the wording of Section\n11(2) (of the Nigerian National Petroleum\nCorporation Act) is clear enough on the form of the\nNotice. Exhibit B falls short of the requirement.\nAccordingly, the appeal fails and is hereby\ndismissed ...\"(parenthesis and italics mine).\nThe plaintiff has appealed further to this\u00a0court\nchallenging the decision of the Court of Appeal.\nBriefs of argument were filed and exchanged by the\nparties. In the appellant's brief, four issues have\nbeen postulated for our determination. The issues\nread thus -\n\"(a) Whether or not Exhibit 'B' (i.e. letter of\ndemand from appellant's Solicitors) is a valid notice\nwithin the meaning and intendment of the N.N.P.C.\nAct, 1977.\n(b) Even if Exhibit 'B' is not a valid notice (which is\n8\ndenied), whether or not such privileges as\nconferred by Section 11(2) of the N.N.P.C. Act,\n1977 extend to suits for breach of contracts of\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/61\nemployment such as in the instant case.\n(c) Whether or not the Court of Appeal judges (sic)\nhave occasioned injustice to the appellant when\nthey failed to appreciate the need for them to be\nguided by the issues raised for determination\nbefore them and therefore failed to appreciate the\ncase before them properly and/or failed to invoke\nthe provisions of Section 6 of the 1979\nConstitution.\n(d) Whether or not the respondents knew or could\nhave known the appellant's place of abode as at the\ntime of Exhibit 'B'.\nWhile the respondent's brief raised three issues for\nus to determine-\n3.01. Whether Exhibit B (the letter of demand from\nthe appellant's Solicitors to the respondent) is a\nvalid Notice within the provisions of Section 11(2)\nof the N.N.P.C. Act.\n3.02. Did the appellant suffer any 'miscarriage of\njustice' because the Court of Appeal failed to\npronounce on whether the Notice contemplated by\nSection 11(2) of the N.N.P.C. Act applies to suits\nfor breach of contract of employment.\n3.03. Whether lack of knowledge of the appellant's\nplace of abode was the basis for the decision of the\nCourt of Appeal.\nAs can be observed, respondent's issues for\ndetermination correspond with issues (a) (b) and\n(d) of the appellant's issues respectively though\n9\ndifferently expressed. Appellant's issue (c) is not\nbased on any of the three grounds of appeal\ncontained in his notice of appeal. It therefore goes\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n10/61\nto no issue. The respondent is also right when it\nraised preliminary objection in its brief of argument\nwhich it termed \"Rejoinder\", that the constitutional\npoint touched by the issue was not raised in the\nCourt of Appeal. I am inclined to discountenance\nthe issue because it is not supported by a ground of\nappeal and not for the reason stated by the\nrespondent since any challenge to jurisdiction,\nbeing fundamental, could be raised at any time and\nin this\u00a0Court even if not raised in the lower\u00a0Courts.\nThe facts of this case as relevant to the case are\nbriefly as follows.\nThe appellant was employed by the respondent by a\nletter dated 17th November, 1978 as a Senior\nSupervisor. He rose in the employment to the\nposition of a Tanker Captain. On 17th July, 1985, a\nquery was issued by the respondent to the\nappellant and at the same time he was suspended\nfrom duty on half pay. Despite this, the appellant\nclaims that he did not receive any pay during the\nsuspension period. By a letter reference No.\nAD/PER./C.1996/442 of 31st December, 1986,\naddressed to the appellant by the respondent, the\nformer was dismissed from its employment. The\nletter which was marked as Exhibit \"A\" annexed to\nthe appellant's counter-affidavit in the High Court\nA. It reads as follows:\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Falomo\nOffice Complex, Ikoyi, PMB 12701, Lagos\n10\nRef: AD/PER/C.1996/442\nDate: 31st December,\u00a01986.\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n11/61\nMr. E.C.C.

Mokwe (Mrs.)\nFor: General Manager, A & P.\"\nThe appellant contended that his dismissal was\ncontrary to his condition of service and was\ntherefore \"discriminatory, wrongful, irregular,\nmalicious and ill motivated.\"\nBy a letter dated the 29th January, 1987 written to\nthe respondent by his Solicitors, Idowu Sofola &\nCo., which was annexed to his counter-affidavit and\nmarked as Exhibit \"B\", reference was made to the\nletters which suspended the appellant from duty\nand dismissed him respectively. Exhibit \"B\" reads in\npart thus\n\" ...The corporation's acts of suspension and\ndismissal are malicious, wrongful, unlawful, null\nand void and of no effect.\n11\nWe are instructed to demand an immediate\nwithdrawal\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/61\nof the letters of suspension and\ndismissal and the prompt reinstatement of our\nclient on his job.

Later, pleadings were\nfiled and exchanged between the parties. In its\nStatement of Defence, the respondent raised the\nissue of insufficiency of notice to sue in paragraphs\n33 and 34 thereof, quoted above.\nAt the hearing of this appeal, both counsel for the\nparties adopted their briefs of argument and did not\nadvance any oral argument. I intend to consider\ntogether all the three issues raised by the\n12\nappellant, which I consider valid.\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/61\nThe appellant argues that the address of his\nSolicitors contained in Exhibit 'B\" to his counter-\naffidavit suffices as his own personal address in\nmeeting the requirement of Section 11 \u00a0Subsection\n(2) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation\nAct, 1977 (now \u00a0Section 12(2) of Cap. 320 of the\nLaws of the Federation of Nigeria, 1990). It is being\ncanvassed that the\u00a0Section envisages that a\nprospective plaintiff may validly serve a notice on\nthe respondent either by himself or by his agent\nincluding a solicitor. It is submitted that where the\nprovision of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it\nadmits of no qualification since the overriding\nprinciple for interpretation of statutes is that the\nCourts have a duty to discover the intention of\nlegislature as deducible from the language of the\nstatute to be construed. The cases of Sode & Ors. v.\nA.G., of the Federation & Ors., (1986) 2 NWLR\n(pt.24) 568; Anisminic v. Foreign Compensations,\n(1969) 2 A.C. 147 and Barclays Bank v. Central\nBank of Nigeria, (1976) 1 All NLR (Pt.1) 409 are\ncited in support.\nAppellant refers to the ratio of the Court of Appeal's\ndecision in holding that the notice given to the\nrespondent was insufficient and its reliance on the\ncase of Bright v. E.D. Lines Ltd. & Anor, (1952) 20\nNLR 79. He submits that the decision is erroneous\nbecause the Act in question contemplates that a\npotential plaintiff may bring an action against the\nrespondent through his agent. It is argued in the\nalternative that if\u00a0Section 11(2) is considered to be\n13\ncapable of having two meanings, then, the meaning\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n14/61\nwhich preserves the jurisdiction of the\u00a0Court should\nbe adopted in line with the decision of this\u00a0Court in\nSode's case (supra). It is further argued that the\nfacts of Bright's case (supra) relied upon by the\nCourt of Appeal are distinguishable from those of\nthe present case because in the former case, the\nprescribed notice was addressed to the wrong\nperson not specified by the Railway Ordinance,\nwhich is not the situation in the present case. The\npurpose for which the notice under\u00a0Section 11(2) is\nrequired is argued to be that the prospective\ndefendant is not taken by surprise but given\nsufficient time to prepare to deal with the claim in\nits defence as laid down by this\u00a0Court in the case of\nKatsina Local Government v. Makudawa, (1971) 1\nNMLR 100 at p.107.\nAppellant argues further that this\u00a0Court has held on\na number of occasions that to do substantial\njustice, it will rely on substance rather than form -\nSee Aliyu Bello & 13 Ors. v. A.G., of Oyo State,\n(1986) 5 NWLR (Pt.45) 828. It is submitted that if\nthe address in Exhibit B was not sufficient, the\nrespondent cannot claim or be considered not to\nknow the address of the appellant in view of his\naddress written by the respondent in the letter of\n31st December, 1986 dismissing him from service,\nwhich preceded Exhibit \"B\" written on 29th\nJanuary, 1987.\nWith regard to issues (b) and (d), it is argued that\nthe Court of Appeal was in error for not\nconsidering, in line with the decisions in the cases\n14\nof A.G., Anambra State v. Onuselogu Enterprises\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/61\nLtd., (1987) 4 NWLR (Pt.66) 547; Uhunmwangho v.\nOkojie (1989) 5 NWLR (Pt.l22) 471 and U.B.N v.\nNwaokolo (1995) 6 NWLR (Pt.400) 127 at p. 149,\nhaving held that Exhibit \"B\" was not sufficient\nnotice, that whether the provisions of Section 11(2)\ncan apply to Common Law actions for breach of\ncontract including contract of employment as was\nheld in N.P.A. v. Construzioni Generali & Anor.\n(1974) 12 S.c. 81 which differs from the earlier\ndecision in the case of N.B.C. v. Bankole (1972) All\nNLR (Pt.l) 327. Other cases cited in support of the\nsubmission are Salako v. L.E.D.B. and Anor., 20\nNLR 189 and Midland Rly Co. v. Local Board\n(1882-3) 11 QBD 788.\nIn reply, the respondent argues in its brief that\nSection 11(2) makes it mandatory for the appellant\nto give the respondent prescribed thirty day's\nnotice and that the notice should contain the\nfollowing details - (i) cause of action; (ii)\nparticulars of claim, (iii) the name and place of\nabode of the intending plaintiff and (iv) the relief\nwhich he claims should be clearly and explicitly\nstated. That these provisions which are similar to\nthose of\u00a0Section 97(2) of the Nigerian Ports\nAuthority Act, 1952 must be complied with strictly.\nIt cites the case of Umukoro v. N P.A. (1997)\n4NWLR (Part 502) 656 at p. 667D and Montosa Nig.\nLtd. v. N P.A. Suit No. ID/685/83 (unreported)\njudgment delivered on 31st March, 1987 by\nOnalaja, J. (as he then was). It is submitted that\nthe solicitor's address given by the respondent in\n15\nExhibit \"B\" is not sufficient to meet the\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/61\nrequirement of\u00a0Section 11(2) which provides that\nthe \"name and place of abode of the intending\nplaintiffs, shall clearly and explicitly\" be \"stated\".\nSince these words are clear and unambiguous, they\nmust be given their grammatical and ordinary\nmeanings in accordance with the decisions in -\nBronik Motors v. Wema Bank Ltd. (1983) 1SCNLR\n296; NICON v. Power & Industrial Eng. Co. Ltd.,\n(1986) 1 NWLR (Pt.l4) 1; (1986) I S.C. 1; Kaycee\nNig. Ltd. v. Prompt Shipping Co. Ltd.

Again, it is argued that Exhibit B\ndid not state the particulars of claim as prescribed\nby\u00a0Section 11(2) and the learned trial Judge so\nfound that the failure of the appellant to comply\nwith all the provisions of Section 11(2) is fatal and\nrenders the suit incompetent. The cases of Katsina\nLocal Govt. v. Makudawa, (supra) at Pp. 105-6 and\nAnambra State Government v. Nwankwo (1995) 9\nNWLR (Pt. 418) 245 were cited in support of the\nargument.\nRespondent concedes that two issues were raised in\nthe Court of Appeal for the consideration of the\nCourt but only one issue was dealt with by the\nCourt of Appeal. The second issue not considered\nreads - \"Whether the notice contemplated by\n16\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/61\nSection 11(2) of the N.N.P.C. Act applies to suits for\nbreach of contract of employment.\" It is being\nargued by the respondent that the questions to be\nconsidered are: \"Is the decision of the Court of\nAppeal in not considering the second issue\nprejudicial to the appellant?\" or \"Did the appellant\nsuffer a miscarriage of justice because of this\nerror?\" Relying on the decisions in Devi v. Roy,\n(1946) A.C. 508 at P. 521; Herbert v. Lankershim,\n71 P. 2d. 220 at pp 253-4 paragraphs 26-28 and\nAlcorn v. Davies 343 p. 2d 621 at Pp. 625-626\nparagraphs 9-11 the respondent submitted that not\nall errors lead to miscarriage of justice but errors\nthat are substantial with the resulting effect that\nthe appellant may likely have a judgment in its\nfavour in the absence of the error. It is contended\nthat the appellant in the present case is not likely\nto have judgment in his favour even if it is\nsuggested that Section 11(2) does not apply to\ncontract between the parties because it affords\nabsolute protection to the respondent. Reference is\nbeing made to the decision of this Court in N.P.A. v.\nConstruzioni (supra) at p. 99 on the provisions of\nSection 97(2) of the Ports Authority Act, 1954 (Cap.\n155 of the Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 1958)\nwhich has the same provisions as Section 11(2) of\nthe Nigerian National Petroleum Act, 1977. Finally\nit is submitted that Section 11(2) would not afford\nprotection to the respondent on an action founded\non contract except where it could be shown that the\ncontract is \"done, omitted or neglected to be done\nunder the powers granted by the Act.\" That the\n17\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/61\ncontract of employment entered into between the\nappellant and the respondent was bound to make in\naccordance with provisions of Section 3(1) of the\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act which\nprovides -\n\"3(1) Subject to this Act, the Corporation may\nappoint such persons as members of staff of the\nCorporation as it considers necessary and may\napprove conditions of service including provision for\nthe payment of pensions.\"\nAt the end of the addresses by counsel for the\nparties, the appeal was adjourned for judgment.\nHowever, a few days later, counsel for the\nrespondent wrote two letters to the Court citing the\nfollowing cases in support of the respondent's case-\nN.N.P.C. v. Fawehinmi (1998) 7 NWLR (Pt.559)\n598;Atolagbe v. Awuni (1997) 9 NWLR (Pt.522)\n536; Obeta v. Okpe (1996) 9 NWLR (Pt. 473) 401\nand Fawehinmi Construction Co. Ltd. v. O.A. U.\n(1998) 6 NWLR (Pt. 553) 195. Counsel for the\nappellant also sent a letter on the same day (9th\nMarch, 2000) as the respondent's first letter, citing\ntwo cases, namely, Santana Medical Services v.\nN.P.A. (1999) 12 NWLR (Pt.630) 189 at p. 202 and\nAmao v. Civil Service Commission, (1992) 7 NWLR\n(Pt. 252) 214 at Pp. 228-9 which he stated to have\napproved the decision in N.P.A. v. Construzion\nGenerali (1974) 12 S.C. 81 earlier cited by him in\nsupport of the appellant's case.\nNow, it is necessary to point out that although the\njurisdiction of the trial Court to entertain the\nplaintiff's action was challenged in paragraphs 33\n18\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/61\nand 34 of the defendant's statement of defence, on\nthe basis of the provisions of Section 3(3) of the\nCivil Service Commission and Other Statutory\nBodies Decree, No. 16 of 1984 and\u00a0Section 11(2) of\nthe Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act,\n1977, the motion on notice the defendant brought\nmerely asked the trial\u00a0Court to strike out the action\non the ground that the appropriate notice under\nthe 1977 Act was not given to the defendant before\nthe action was commenced. It is therefore, to be\nnoted that the\u00a0Courts below based their decisions\non the provisions of the 1977 Act only and rightly\nmade no reference whatsoever to the provisions of\nSection 3(3) of the 1984 Decree.\nSection 11 of the 1977 Act is in two parts. It\nprovides -\n\"11(1) Notwithstanding anything in any other\nenactment, no suit against the Corporation, a\nmember of the Board or any employee of the\nCorporation for any act done in pursuance or\nexecution of any enactment or law, or of any public\nduties or authority, or in respect of any alleged\nneglect or default in the execution of such\nenactment or law, or of any public duties or\nauthority, shall lie or be instituted in any\u00a0Court\nunless it is commenced within twelve months next\nafter the act, neglect or default complained of or, in\nthe case of a continuance of damage or injury,\nwithin twelve months next after the ceasing\nthereof.\n(2) No suit shall be commenced against the\nCorporation before the expiration of a period of one\n19\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/61\nmonth after written notice of intention to\ncommence the suit shall have been served upon\nthe Corporation by the intending plaintiff or his\nagent and the notice shall clearly and explicitly\nstate the cause of action, the particulars of the\nclaim, the name and place of abode of the intending\nplaintiff and the relief which he claims.\"\nWhile Subsection (1) deals with the limitation of the\ntime within which an action could be commenced\nagainst the Corporation, Subsection (2) provides\nthat one month notice of intention to sue must be\ngiven to the Corporation before the action is\ncommenced. In the present case, we are only\nconcerned with the provisions of Subsection (2)\nupon which the defendant relied in bringing the\nmotion in the High Court for the plaintiff's action to\nbe struck out for want of jurisdiction. The word\n\"shall\" as underlined above, appears three times in\nSubsection (2).\nIt\u00a0is\u00a0settled\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0word\u00a0\"shall\",\u00a0when\u00a0used\u00a0in\u00a0an\nenactment\u00a0is\u00a0capable\u00a0of\u00a0bearing\u00a0many\u00a0meanings.\u00a0It\nmay\u00a0be\u00a0implying\u00a0futurity\u00a0or\u00a0implying\u00a0a\u00a0mandate\u00a0or\ndirection\u00a0or\u00a0giving\u00a0permission\u00a0- See\nIfezue v. Mbadugha\n, (1984) 1 SCNLR 427 at Pp. 456 - 7. In\nthe present case, we are concerned with whether it\nhas been used in a mandatory sense or directory\nsense.

(H.L.) 214 at Pp. 222 and 235 and\nState v. Ilori\n(1983) 1 SCNLR 94 at P.110. In\nLiverpool Borough Bank v. Turner\n(1861) 30 L.J. Ch. 379 at\nP. 657 it was held -\n\"No universal rule can be laid down for the\nconstruction of statutes as to whether mandatory\nenactments shall be considered directory only or\nobligatory with an implied nullification for\ndisobedience. It is the duty of\u00a0Courts of justice to\ntry and get at the real intention of the legislature\nby carefully attending to the whole scope of the\nstatute to be construed.\"\nIt appears to me that the first \"shall\" in\nSubsection (2)\nimports obligation. No suit could be commenced\nagainst the Corporation until a period of one month\nexpires after giving a prescribed notice. The second\n\"shall\" seems to me to import obligation also.\nBefore suing the Corporation a notice of intention\nto commence the suit must be given to the\nCorporation. However, I am of the opinion that the\nthird \"shall\" connotes direction in the sense in\nwhich it is used. It describes the particulars to be\ncontained in the notice of intention to sue.\nWhile the issuance of the notice by a prospective\nplaintiff is mandatory, the particulars to be included\nin the notice, which are cause of action, particulars\nof claim, name and place of abode of the intending\nplaintiff and the relief to be claimed appear to me\nto be directory. As was held by this\u00a0Court per\nCoker, J.S.C. in the case of\nKatsina Local\u00a0Government v. Makudawa (1971) I NMLR 100 at\n21\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/61\n107, the purpose of giving notice of claim to the\nLocal Government of the claim against it is that it is\nnot taken by surprise but to have adequate time to\nprepare to deal with the claim in its defence. The\npurpose of the notice \"is not to put hazards in the\nway of bringing litigation against it.\" Furthermore\nSection 23 of the Interpretation Act, 1964 (now Cap. 192 of the Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 1990)\nprovides:-\n\"23. Where a form is prescribed by an enactment, a\nform which differs from the prescribed form shall\nnot be invalid for the purposes of the enactment by\nreason only of the difference if the difference is not\nin a material particular and is not calculated to\nmislead. \"\nIn upholding the application brought by the\ndefendant for the suit to be struck out for want of\njurisdiction, the learned trial Judge held as\nfollows:-\n\"What falls for decision in this preliminary point of\nlaw is whether or not the solicitor's letter Exhibit B\nannexed to the plaintiff/respondent's counter-\naffidavit is a notice as required by Section\n11(2). If it is accepted as a notice, the next\nquestion must be - is it a valid or proper notice?\nThere is no doubt that Exhibit B was duly delivered\nto the defendant/applicant by the plaintiff's agent\ni.e. his solicitor. The fact of delivery is not disputed.\nMy view of Exhibit B is that it is the usual solicitor's\ndemand letter. It could serve as notice, but to do\nthis, it must strictly comply with the provisions of\nSection 11(2) which says \"the notice shall clearly\n22\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/61\nand explicitly state ...\" all the four specific\nrequirements which are in my view conjunctive. If\nanyone of them is missing, the notice must for that\nreason be bad.\nIn my judgment, the only requirements that are\nclear and explicit in Exhibit B are the cause of\naction, and the relief sought. These are the\nallegation of unlawful dismissal, and the demand\nfor reinstatement or alternatively, N1,000,000.00\nspecial and general damages respectively. There\nare no particulars of claim shown in Exhibit B, and\nthe plaintiff's place of abode is nowhere shown on\nit. I am unable to accept the submission of learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff that the place of abode of\nplaintiff's agent i.e. his solicitor, will suffice. What\nSection 11(2) says is \"place of abode of the\nintending plaintiff. This is clear and unambiguous.\nIt does not in my view permit any addition which\nwould bring into it the place of abode of the\nplaintiff's agent in the alternative.\nFrom the foregoing, it is clear that the condition\nprecedent set by Section 11(2) has not been met\nby the plaintiff/respondent. He cannot therefore\ncommence this action. In the circumstance this\nCourt has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. It will\nbe and it is hereby struck out.\nIt is clear from the foregoing that the plaintiff's\naction was struck out by the learned trial Judge\nbecause Exhibit \"B\" did not, according to him,\nsatisfy the requirements of Section 11(2)\nparticularly as it did not \"clearly and specifically\nstate ... all the four specific requirements which are\n23\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/61\nin my view, conjunctive. If anyone of them is\nmissing, the notice must for that reason be bad. In\nmy judgment, the only requirements that are clear\nand explicit in Exhibit \"B\" are the cause of action\nand the relief sought.\" The particulars missing from\nExhibit \"B\" were held to be the particulars of claim\nand the place of abode of the plaintiff's solicitor,\nwho acted as the plaintiff's agent.\nOn its part, the Court of Appeal dismissed the\nappellant's appeal also on the basis that the form of\nnotice given to the defendant was insufficient. It\nheld Per Awogu, J.C.A. -\n\" ...the wording of\u00a0Section 11(2) is clear enough on\nthe form of the Notice. Exhibit B falls short of the\nrequirement. Accordingly, the appeal fails and it is\nhereby dismissed ...\"\nCould it rightly be held, as was done by the learned\ntrial Judge and upheld by the\u00a0Court below that the\nfact that the appellant failed to state in Exhibit B,\nthe particulars of claim and his place of abode, the\nnotice is null and void? It is significant that the\nlearned trial Judge found that the first two\nrequirements of Section 11(2) which I have held to\nbe mandatory, had been met by the plaintiff. The\nthird requirement which I have held to be directive\nwas partly met by the plaintiff as held by the\nlearned trial Judge. It is again significant and\ncurious that on the question of place of abode, the\nlearned trial Judge expected that of the Solicitor\nwho wrote Exhibit \"B\" to be given and not that of\nthe intending plaintiff as stated by\u00a0Section 11(2).\nBe that as it may, could the missing particulars in\n24\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/61\nExhibit B amount to \"material particular\" and is\n\"calculated to mislead\" the defendant as laid down\nby\u00a0Section 23 of the Interpretation Act?\nI do not consider the place of abode of the plaintiff\nas material to expressing his intention to sue the\ndefendant. After all, should the plaintiff issue a writ\nof summons, which he did later, his address of\nservice would be contained in the writ. At any rate,\nthe plaintiff was no stranger to the defendant\nhaving been its employee and having been shown\nto have exchanged correspondence with the\ndefendant after his suspension from duty and\ndismissal. Perhaps the situation would have been\ndifferent had the defendant been dealing with a\ncomplete stranger and not its employee. Again, as\nto the particulars of his claim, these can clearly be\ngathered or inferred from Exhibit \"B\" which stated\nthat the plaintiff's dismissal was \"in total disregard\nof the Conditions of Service and all rules and\nprocedure\" and that his suspension from duty and\ndismissal were \"malicious, wrongful, unlawful, null\nand void and of no effect.\"\nIt follows that in my opinion, all the requirements\nof Section 11(2) had been met by the plaintiff. The\ntrial\u00a0Court and the Court of Appeal were in error\nand misdirected themselves when they held\notherwise.\nWith these, I have dealt with issues (a) and (d) in\nthe appellant's brief of argument. Issue (b) is based\non whether Exhibit \"B\" is not a valid notice under\nSection 11(2). This does not arise since I have held\nthat Exhibit B has met the requirements of the\n25\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/61\nSection. The question, therefore, becomes\nhypothetical and academic. Consequently, it will be\nfutile and out of place for us to determine it. As for\nissue (c), I have already held that it is incompetent\nsince it is not hinged on any of the three grounds of\nappeal filed by the appellant.\nPerhaps, I should comment on ground B in the\nappellant's notice of appeal. This ground complains\nthat the Court of Appeal failed to consider\nappellant's second issue for determination before it\nand that the failure occasioned miscarriage of\njustice. Unfortunately, none of the issues for\ndetermination formulated before us touches on the\ncomplaint. The ground of appeal, not supported by\nany issue, becomes incompetent. Paragraph 3.10 of\nthe appellant's brief of argument argues the\ncomplaint in the ground of appeal. This is irregular\nand goes to no issue. It is unacceptable since there\nis no issue formulated on the ground. The\nrespondent also acted in vain when it replied to the\nappellant's contention in this regard in paragraphs\n5.18 to 5.39 of its brief of argument.\nFinally, this appeal succeeds and it must be\nallowed. The chequered history of this case once\nmore brings to light the dilatory effect of\ninterlocutory appeal on the substantive suit\nbetween parties. The action in this case was\nbrought on the 29th day of April, 1987. The motion\non notice to strike out the case for want of\njurisdiction is dated 15th day of April, 1988; that is\nabout a year after the suit was filed. The ruling of\nthe High Court was delivered on the 20th day of\n26\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/61\nJune, 1988.\nThe appeal against the ruling was delivered by the\nCourt of Appeal on the 16th day of February, 1989.\nThe final judgment on the interlocutory appeal is\ndelivered today by this\u00a0Court. It has thus taken\nthirteen years for the case to reach this stage. With\nthe success of the plaintiff's appeal before us, the\ncase is to be sent back to the High Court to be\ndetermined, hopefully, on its merits after a delay of\n13 years. Surely, this could have been avoided had\nit been that the point was taken in the course of\nthe proceedings in the substantive claim to enable\nany aggrieved party to appeal on both the issue of\njurisdiction and the judgment on merit in the\nproceedings as the case might be. I believe that\ncounsel owe it, as a duty, to the\u00a0Court to help\nreduce the period of delay in determining cases in\nour\u00a0Courts by avoiding unnecessary preliminary\nobjections as the one here; so that the adage\n'justice delayed is justice denied' may cease to\napply to the proceedings in our\u00a0Courts.\nOn the whole, the appeal succeeds and it is hereby\nallowed with N10,000.00 costs to the appellant\nagainst the respondent. The case is hereby\nremitted to the High Court of Lagos State to be\nheard by another judge other than A.O. Silva. J.\nADOLPHUS GODWIN KARIBI-WHYTE, J.S.C.: I have read the leading\u00a0judgment of my Lord, the Chief Justice of Nigeria,\u00a0Hon. Justice M. L. Uwais in this appeal. I agree\nentirely with his conclusion that this appeal\nsucceeds and be allowed .\n27\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/61\nThis is an appeal against the judgment of the Court\nof Appeal, Lagos Judicial Division, which on the\n16th February, 1989 dismissed the appeal of the\nappellant.\nThe facts of this case are very short, undisputed\nand concisely stated as follows-\nAppellant was in full time, permanent and\npensionable employment of the respondent's\nCorporation. On the 16th July, 1985, respondent\nwrote to him in a letter suspending him from the\nemployment on half-pay during the period of\nsuspension. In another letter dated 31st December,\n1986 he was dismissed with effect from 31st\nDecember, 1985. Appellant thereafter filed a suit\nagainst the respondent for a declaration that his\npurported suspension and subsequent dismissal\nwere wrongful, illegal, null and void and of no\neffect. He sought for an order restraining the\ndefendant, their servants, agents and/or privies\nfrom preventing him from continuing his job as\nHead of Operations/Technical Department.\nAppellant claimed NI8,700, being arrears of salaries\nfrom July, 1985 to April, 1987 at the rate of N850\nper month until judgment.\nIn the alternative, he claimed for N1,000,000,being\nspecial and general damages for unlawful, irregular\nand malicious determination of his employment or\nbreach of his contract of service with the\ndefendant's Corporation. Both parties filed their\npleadings. In the statement of claim, the plaintiff in\nparagraphs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 averred as\nfollows -\n28\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n29/61\n\"19. The plaintiff says that on or about the 17th\nJuly, 1985, the defendants caused to be served on\nhim two different letters both Ref. AD/PER/C.\n1996/Vol. 111/343, and also both dated 16th July,\n1985, one being headed \"QUERY\" and the other\n\"SUSPENSION FROM DUTY\". The plaintiff will rely\non both letters at the trial.\n10. The plaintiff duly replied to the query and will\nrely on same at the trial.\n11. The plaintiff says that although the Letter of\nSuspension expressly put the plaintiff \"on half pay\nfrom the period,\" he was not paid any amount.\n12. The plaintiff continued to offer his services\nwhich offer was continuously turned down and\nrejected.\n13. By a letter Ref. AD/PER/C. 1996/442 dated the\n31st December, 1986, the defendants purported to\nDISMISS the plaintiff from their services \"With\neffect from 31st December, 1985\" - the plaintiff\nhaving been kept away from his job on suspension\nfor one and a half (1'/2) years and the 'dismissal'\nexpressed to take a retrospective effect.\n14. While he was on 'suspension', the plaintiff made\nseveral representations to the defendants for his\nreinstatement, without result. The plaintiff will\nfound on his several letters to the defendants,\nincluding letters dated 23/5/86 addressed to the\nHonourable Minister and the Managing Director;\n23/7/86 to the Managing Director; 27/8/86 to the\nHon. Minister and 8/8/86 to the Hon. Minister.\n15. The plaintiff will show at the trial of this action\nthat the defendants failed, refused and/or\n29\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n30/61\nneglected to comply with, adhere to or in any way,\nto follow the procedure stipulated for suspension\nand/or dismissal as enjoined by the \"Conditions of\nService' binding the parties or at all.\"\nDefendants having denied paragraphs\n1,4,7,8,13,14,15 in paragraph 1 of the statement\nof defence admitted paragraphs 9, 10, 11 of the\nstatement of claim in paragraph 2 of their\nstatement of defence. Paragraphs 32, 33 and 34 of\nthe statement of defence which is the crux of this\nmatter aver as follows -\n\"32. The defendant avers that the plaintiff is not\nentitled to any damages be it special or general and\nthat all he is entitled to is the sum of N204.30 as\npleaded above.\n33. The defendant would at the hearing of this suit\nraise the issue of law that the\u00a0Court has no\njurisdiction to hear this matter in view of the\nprovisions of Section 3(3) of the Civil Service\nCommissions and Other Statutory Bodies (Removal\nof Certain Persons from Office) Decree No. 16 of\n1984\n34. The defendant would also at the hearing of this\nsuit raise the issue of law that the suit is\nincompetent for the plaintiff's failure to comply with\nthe provisions of\u00a0Section 11(2) of the Nigerian\nNational Petroleum Corporation Act 1977 in that no\nwritten notice of his intention to commence this\nsuit wherein the cause of action, particulars of\nclaim, relief claimed and place of abode of the\nplaintiff should have been stated was served by the\nplaintiff on the defendant. Whereupon the\n30\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/61\ndefendant contends that the plaintiff's claim is\nfrivolous and misconceived and should be dismissed\nwith cost.\"\nIn plaintiff's reply to the averment in paragraph 34\nof the statement of defence, he averred as follows -\n\"In further denial of paragraphs 18-34 of the\ndefendant's statement of defence, he categorically\ndenies the application of the Civil Service\nCommissions and Other Statutory Bodies (Removal\nof Certain Persons from Office) Decree No. 16 of\n1984 as pleaded or at all and avers that he\ncomplied with Section 11(2) of the Nigerian\nNational Petroleum Corporation Act 1977.\"\nDefendants then filed a Motion to strike out the suit\nfor want of jurisdiction on the following grounds -\n(a) The plaintiff/respondent did not give to the\ndefendant/applicant the statutory notice required\nby Section 11(2) of the Nigerian National Petroleum\nCorporation Act, 1977.\n(b) This is a point of law which is likely to be\ndecisive of this litigation.\nThe immediate reaction of learned counsel to the\nplaintiff was the filing of a counter- affidavit in\nwhich it was averred as follows -\n(4) That to my knowledge and according to the\ninformation from both the plaintiff and his counsel,\nwhich I believe, the plaintiff instructed our\nChambers, Idowu Sofola & Co. to take up the\nmatter on his behalf.\n(5) That our said Chambers issued a letter Ref.\nIS/32/81/Ca. of the 29th January, 1987, addressed\nto the Managing Director of the defendant's\n31\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/61\nCorporation and copies to their Minister and\nGeneral Manager, which I personally served on the\nsame 29th January, 1987, a copy of which letter is\nattached hereto and marked \"B.\"\n(6) That my Despatch Book was signed as evidence\nof the receipts of the letters referred to at\nparagraph 5 above, a copy of the relevant page of\nthe Book is exhibited and marked Exhibit C.\"\nThe defendant's motion came up for hearing. After\nargument, the learned trial Judge held on the 20th\nJune, 1988 that he had no jurisdiction to entertain\nthe suit on the ground that Exhibit \"B\" was not in\ncompliance with the notice prescribed in\u00a0Section\n11(2) of the Nigerian National Petroleum\nCorporation Act 1977 and struck out the claim.\nAppellant appealed to the Court of Appeal on two\ngrounds of appeal challenging the interpretation of\nSection 11(2) of the NNPC Act 1977 by the learned\ntrial Judge. After hearing arguments of the parties\nand considering their briefs of argument, the Court\nof Appeal relying on the interpretation of the\nprovisions of\u00a0Section 40(2) of the Railways\nOrdinance Cap. 191 which provided for notice\nsimilar to the one now in issue, the\u00a0Court on the\n16th February, 1989 dismissed the appeal. It held\nthat Exhibit B fell short of the requirement.\nConsiderable weight was given to the opinion of\nAdemola .J in Bright v. E.D. Line Ltd. & Anor.\n(1952) 20 NLR 79 where the learned Judge\nconstrued the provision of Section 40(2) of the\nRailways Ordinance as follows:-\n\"There might have been some weight in that\n32\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n33/61\nargument if the Ordinance had merely enacted that\nit should be brought to the notice of the Railway\nadministration that an action would be brought\nagainst it. But it is clear that it is not mere\nknowledge but a proper notice in accordance with\nthe Section of the Ordinance is what is required.\nThe wording of the Ordinance is clear enough as to\nwho must be served and the method of service. \"\nA similar, but not identical notice is now before us,\nappellant has filed three grounds of appeal. Both\nlearned counsel to the parties filed their briefs of\nargument which they adopted and relied upon in\nargument before us. He has also formulated four\nissues for determination arising from the grounds\nof appeal. Learned counsel to the respondent has\nformulated only three issues for determination. I\nset out below the issues formulated by both learned\ncounsel.\nAPPELLANT'S ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION\n\"(a) Whether or not Exhibit 'B' (i.e. letter of\ndemand from appellant's Solicitors) is a valid notice\nwithin the meaning and intendment of the NNPC\nAct, 1977.\n(b) Even if Exhibit 'B' is not a valid notice (which is\ndenied), whether or not such privileges as\nconferred by Section 11(2) of the NNPC Act 1977\nextend to suits for breach of contracts of\nemployment such as in the instant case.\n(c) Whether or not the Court of Appeal judges have\noccasioned injustice to the appellant when they\nfailed to appreciate the need for them to be guided\nby the issues raised for determination before them\n33\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n34/61\nand therefore failed to appreciate the case before\nthem\nproperly and/or failed to invoke the\nprovisions of Section 6 of the 1979 Constitution.\n(d) Whether or not the respondents knew or could\nhave known the appellant's place of abode as at the\ntime of Exhibit 'B'.\nRespondent's Issues for Determination\n\"1. Whether Exhibit B (the letter of demand from\nthe appellant's Solicitors to the respondent) is a\nvalid Notice within the provisions of Section 11(2)\nof the N.N.P.C. Act.\n2. Did the appellant suffer any \"miscarriage of\njustice \" because the Court of Appeal failed to\npronounce on whether the Notice contemplated by\nSection 11(2) of the N.N.P.C. Act applies to suits\nfor breach of contract of employment.\n3. Whether lack of knowledge of the appellant's\nplace of abode was the basis for the decision of the\nCourt of Appeal.\nI consider the issues for determination as\nformulated by the respondent sufficient for the\npurposes of this appeal. Issue 1 which relates to\nthe adequacy vel non of the notice in Exhibit \"B\" is\nidentical in both formulations and seems to me the\npoint on which the appellant's suit was struck out in\nthe High Court and on which the appeal was\ndismissed in the\u00a0Court below. Appellant seems to\nrest the fate of the appeal entirely on his argument\non the determination of this issue.\nLearned counsel to the appellant submitted in his\nbrief of argument that he was relying on the same\nargument he urged on the\u00a0Court below, which is\n34\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n35/61\nthat the address of his solicitor should suffice as his\nown personal address as required by Section 11(2)\nof the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act\n1977. He argued that since\u00a0Section 11(2) envisaged\nservice of the notice by the plaintiff or by his agent,\nthe respondent could not reasonably insist that a\nnotice from the Agent is not in compliance with the\nprovisions of the\u00a0Section.\nLearned counsel accepted the general principle that\nwhere the language of the provisions of a statute is\nunambiguous and clear, it should be given its plain\nnatural meaning. He however argued that since the\nduty of interpretation is to discover the intention of\nthe legislation as deduced from the words used,\nthere is the duty to ensure that the right of access\nto the\u00a0Courts is not taken away as restricted by the\nwords of the statute. He cited Sode & Ors. v. A.G.,\nFederation & Ors. (1986) 2 NWLR (Pt.24) 568;\nAnisministic v. Foreign Compensations Tribunal\n(1969) 2 AC. 147; Barclays Bank v. Central Bank of\nNigeria (1976) 1 All NLR (Pt.1) 409.\nIt was submitted that the ratio of the judgment of\nthe Court of Appeal is that Exhibit B did not suffice\nas a valid notice within the intendment of Section\n11(2) of the NNPC Act. The Justices relied on Bright\nv. E.D. Lines Ltd. & Anor. (1952) 20 NLR 79 in\ncoming to this decision which appellant regards as\nerroneous. It was submitted that the said provision\nis capable of two meanings. In such a circumstance\nthe meaning which preserves the ordinary\njurisdiction of the\u00a0Court should be preferred - Sode\nv. A. G., of the Federal & \u00a0O rs. (supra). Learned\n35\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n36/61\ncounsel distinguished the case of Bright v. E.D.\nLines Ltd. (supra) as one in which the notice was\naddressed to the wrong person. Further, it was\nsubmitted that the provisions of the Ordinance\nwere very clear and unambiguous and that the\nproper notice had accordingly not been sent.\nLearned counsel cited in support the decision of this\nCourt in Katsina Local Government v. Makudawa\n(1971) 1 NMLR 100 at p. 107 where Section 116(2)\nof the Local Government Law similar to Section\n11(2) was construed. The\u00a0Court stated the purpose\nof the notice as follows -\n\"The purpose after all of Section 116(2) is solely to\ngive the Local Authority sufficient notice of claims\nagainst it so that it is not taken by surprise but has\nadequate time to prepare to deal with the matter in\nits defence. Its purpose is not to put hazards in the\nway of bringing litigation against it, any more than\nthe requirement of Section 116(1) is to formulate\nin technical terms the claim but to give notice of\nthe facts relied on for the claim though not to\nestablish in his notice a good cause of action.\"\nLearned counsel to the appellant submitted that the\nCourt below appreciated the fact that if respondent\nknew the place of abode of the appellant at the\ntime the notice, Exhibit B was written, i.e. on\nJanuary 20, 1997, failure to repeat the\nplaintiff/appellant's place of abode in Exhibit B,\ncould not be fatal. It was submitted that the\ndefendant at the time of writing Exhibit A, the\nletter of dismissal in December 31, 1986 knew the\nplace of abode of the plaintiff.\n36\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n37/61\nFinally on this issue, learned counsel summed up\nhis submission by stating that the purpose of giving\nnotice is to warn the defendants of the claim and to\ngive them an opportunity to settle if they wish. The\nplaintiff's address is required to enable defendant\nmake any comment if they wish through that\naddress. It was submitted that since plaintiff was\nacting through a solicitor, it should be sufficient for\nthe benefit of the respondent as required by\u00a0Section\n11(2) of the NNPC Act. It could never have been\nthe intention of the statute that in cases where the\nplaintiff acts through solicitors (agents), the\nCorporation should still go over the solicitors\n(agents) to deal with the client. It was submitted\nthat the\u00a0Section cannot be conceived as requiring\nthe address of the client as well as that of the\nagent solicitors.\nIn his own submission, learned counsel to the\nrespondents referred to the provision of Section\n11(2) of the NNPC Act, 1977 and pointed out that it\nmade it mandatory for a minimum period of 30\ndays to be given as notice to the Corporation by the\nintending plaintiff. It was submitted that the notice\nshall state (i) the cause of action (ii) the particulars\nof claim (iii) the name and place of abode of the\nintending plaintiff (iv) the relief claimed. Citing\nMontosa Nig. Ltd. v. Nigeria Ports Authority suit No.\nID/685/83 of 31/3/87 (unreported), Umukoro v.\nN.P.A (1997) 4 NWLR (Pt.502) 656, it was submitted\nthat the provision of\u00a0Section 97(2) of the NPA Act,\nwhich are in pari materia with\u00a0A are to be complied with strictly.\n37\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n38/61\nIt was submitted that in the interpretation of\nstatutes, words used are to be given their ordinary,\nnatural grammatical meanings, where they are\nplain, clear and unambiguous. Learned counsel\nrelied for this proposition on Bronik Motors v.\nWema Bank Ltd. (1983) 1SCNLR296; NICON v.\nPower & Industries Eng. co. Ltd. (1986)\n1NWLR(Pt.l4) 1; (1986) 1S.C. 1; Kaycee Nigeria\nLtd. v. Prompt Shipping Corporation (1986) 1NWLR\n(Pt.l5) 180; (1986) 1SC 328; Abaye v. Ofili & Anor.\n(1986) 1NWLR (PUS) 134; (1986) 1 Sc. 231; NPA\nv. Ali Akar & Sons (1965) 1 All NLR 259; Owena\nBank Pic v. N.S.E. Ltd. (1997) 8 NWLR (Pt.515) 1\nand 7Up Bottling Co. Ltd. v. Abiola & Sons Ltd.\n(1995) 3 NWLR (Pt.383) 257 at P. 276.\nLearned counsel then referred to the relevant\nexpression of the \"place of abode of the intending\nplaintiff\" in\u00a0Section 11(2) of the NNPC Act 1977. He\nargued that this is properly referrable only to the\nplace of residence or business of the plaintiff and\ncannot be extended to include the address of his\nagent or solicitor as contended by learned counsel\nto the appellant. The non-inclusion of the\nexpression \"or his agent\" in the provision was\ndeliberate. Accordingly, the address of counsel to\nthe appellant cannot satisfy the provisions of\nSection 11(2).\nIt was further submitted that the learned trial\nJudge found that Exhibit B did not state the\nparticulars of claim. Finally it was submitted that\nfailure to comply with the provisions of Section\n11(2) of the NNPC Act 1977 renders the suit\n38\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n39/61\nagainst the respondent incompetent. The decisions\nin Katsina Local Authority v. Makudawa (1971)\n1NMLR 100 and Anambra State Government v.\nNwankwo (1995) 9 NWLR (Pt.418) 245 were cited\nand relied upon. The learned trial Judge was right\nto have struck out the appellant's suit.\nSince the resolution of this issue is dependent upon\nthe interpretation of the provisions of Section 11(2)\nNNPC Act 1977, it is crucial to consider the\ncontentions of learned counsel on the issue. The\nprovisions of Section \u00a011\u00a0(2) of the NNPC Act, 1977 is\nthat \"No suit shall be commenced against the\nCorporation before the expiration of a period of one\nmonth after written notice of intention to\ncommence the suit shall have been served upon\nthe Corporation by the intending plaintiff or his\nagent; and the notice shall clearly and explicitly\nstate the cause of action, the particulars of the\nclaim, the name and place of abode of the intending\nplaintiff and the relief which he claims.\"\nThe competent contentions between appellant that\nexhibit \"B\" has satisfied the above requirements\nand respondent that it did not rely on the\ninterpretation of the provision by the Court of\nAppeal. The real issue before us is whether the\nCourt below was right to hold that Exhibit B did not\ncomply with the requirement as to notice\nprescribed in\u00a0Section \u00a011\u00a0(2) of the NNPC Act, 1977.\nIt is relevant to refer to the judgment of the\u00a0Court\nbelow construing the provision, where it was said at\np. 85,\n\" ...according to the defence, the plaintiff's\n39\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n40/61\nwhereabouts was unknown and he could not be\nserved with the letter of dismissal until \"he\npetitioned the Honourable Minister of Petroleum in\nlate 1986 and his whereabouts was then known to\nthe defendant.\" In other words, the plaintiff's\naddress remained unknown even as of Exhibit B;\nwhereas Section 11(2) required him to state his\n\"place of abode\". The Court of Appeal accepted the\nopinion of the learned trial Judge that compliance\nwith Section 11(2) is a condition precedent to the\ncommencement of any suit against the respondent.\nIt would seem to me clear from the judgment that\nthe Court of Appeal relied entirely on the authority\nof Bright v. E.D. Lines (1952) 20 NLR 79 in its\ndetermination whether Exhibit \"B\" was in\ncompliance with the provisions of the said\u00a0Section\n11(2) of the NNPC Act, 1977. It is helpful to\nreproduce the relevant part of the judgment in full.\nI do so hereunder -\n\"In Bright v. E.D. Lines Ltd. & Anor. (1952)20NLR\n79, the issue was Notice under\u00a0Section 40(2) of the\nRailway Ordinance, Cap. 191, which provided for\nnotice similar to the one now in issue. The lawyer\nhad written on behalf of claimants and ended the\nletter thus:\n\"I am to state that if on or before the 18th instant,\nthe claim is not satisfied, my instructions are to\ntake out a writ against you, and without further\nnotice.\"\nAs it turned out, the letter was addressed to the\nWharf Superintendent, Nigerian Railway, Port\nHarcourt instead of to the General Manager,\n40\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n41/61\nNigerian Railway, Ebute-Metta. In addition, the\ndetails of the claim were not sufficiently set out. It\nwas however argued that so long as the Railway\nAdministration was aware of the claim, it was\nenough. Adetokunbo, Ademola J, (as he then was)\ndid not agree, and said at page 80:-\n\"There might have been some weight in that\nargument if the Ordinance had merely enacted that\nit should be brought to the notice of the Railway\nAdministration that an action would be brought\nagainst it. But it is dear that it is not mere\nknowledge but a proper notice in accordance with\nthe\u00a0Section of the Ordinance that is required. The\nwording of the Ordinance is clear enough as to who\nmust be served and the method of service. \"\nSo too, in the instant appeal, the wording of\nSection 11(2) is clear enough on the form of the\nNotice. Exhibit \"B\" falls short of the requirement.\"\nThis is the interpretation challenged by the\nappellant.\nIt is important to observe that the\ndecision in Bright v. E.D. Lines Ltd. (supra) relied\nupon by the Court of Appeal is a judgment of the\nHigh Court. Besides, the case is distinguishable on\nthe facts. The ratio decidendi of that case was that\nthere was non-compliance with Section 40(2)\nbecause Notice was addressed to the wrong person,\nnamely to the Wharf Superintendent, Nigerian\nRailway, Port Harcourt, instead of the General\nManager, Nigerian Railway, as required by\u00a0Sections\n2, 41 of the Railway Ordinance. Accordingly, no\nnotice was sent within the meaning of Section\n40(2). The name and address of the intending\n41\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n42/61\nplaintiff considered in the instant case was not a\nrequirement\nof Section 40(2) and was not\nconsidered. It follows that where the requirement\nof notice is that it should be served on a particular\nperson, service on person other than the person\nstipulated, is a non-compliance with the provision.\nThis is what Bright v. E.D. Lines & Anor (supra) can\nbe held to have decided.\nIt\u00a0is\u00a0common\u00a0ground\u00a0that\u00a0where\u00a0the\u00a0words\u00a0of\u00a0the\nprovisions\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0statute\u00a0are\u00a0clear\u00a0and\u00a0unambiguous,\nthey\u00a0\u00a0should\u00a0\u00a0be\u00a0\u00a0given\u00a0\u00a0their\u00a0\u00a0plain,\u00a0\u00a0ordinary,\ngrammatical\u00a0meaning\u00a0without\u00a0qualification. Learned\ncounsel had submitted that the overriding principle\nof interpretation of statutes is that the\u00a0Courts are\nunder a duty to discover the intention of the law\nmaker as deducible from the language of the\nprovision construed .\nSection 11(2) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Act, 1977\nprovides as follows -\n\"No suit shall be commenced against the\nCorporation before the expiration of a period of one\nmonth after written notice of intention to\ncommence the suit shall have been served upon\nthe Corporation by the intending plaintiff or his\nagent; and the notice shall clearly and explicitly\nstate the cause of action, the particulars of the\nclaim, the name and place of abode of the intending\nplaintiff and the relief which he claims.\"\nIt seems quite clear on analysis of the above\nSection and from the use of the expression \"shall\"\ntherein, that the\u00a0Sub-section makes it mandatory to\ngive notice to the Corporation, and that no suit\n42\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n43/61\nshall be commenced before the expiration of one\nmonth,\u00a0after written notice of intention to\ncommence the suit shall have been served upon\nthe Corporation by the intending plaintiff or his\nagent. This first part is very wide and the opening\nphrase \"No suit shall be commenced\" prohibits the\ncommencement of all suits whatsoever. This was\nthe decision of this\u00a0Court in\nFawehinmi Construction Co. Ltd. v. Obafemi Awolowo University\n(1998) 6 NWLR (Pt.553) 171 , where the provisions\nof\u00a0Section 46(1) University of Ife Edict, in pari\nmateria with Section 11(2) of the NNPC Act, 1977\nwas so construed. It also provides that the suit shall\nhave been served upon the Corporation by the\nintending plaintiff or his agent. Thus, the question\nof service of notice shall be made upon the\nCorporation by the plaintiff or his agent.\nThe second part which uses the same imperative\nexpression \"shall\" prescribes the content of the\nnotice required in the first part. The notice shall\nclearly and explicitly state (a) the cause of action\n(b) particulars of claim, (c) the name and place of\nabode of the intending plaintiff (d) the relief\nclaimed. It seems to me therefore that the\nrequirement of the service of notice upon the\nCorporation of intention to commence a suit against\nthem which shall be made by the intending plaintiff\nor his agent is mandatory, but the contents of the\nnotice are directory statutory requirements - See\nKatsina Local Authority v. Makudawa (1971)\n1NMLR 100 at 105-7; Umukoro v. NPA (1997) 4\nNWLR (pt.502) 656.\n43\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n44/61\nThere is no doubt, and it has not been disputed by\nappellants that the provision of Section 11(2) of the\nNNPC Act, 1977 is a pre-condition for the\ncommencement of suits against the Corporation.\nThe issue before us is whether Exhibit B which has\nnot stated the name and place of abode of the\nintending plaintiff complied with the provision. It\nwas the contention of learned counsel to the\nappellant that it is the duty of the\u00a0Court so to\nconstrue the provision of the statute as to protect\nand preserve the right of access to the\u00a0Courts which\nmay be taken away or restricted by the provision.\nIt was submitted citing the dictum of this\u00a0Court in\nKatsina Local Authority v. Makudawa (supra) that -\n\"The purpose after all, of\u00a0Section 116(2) is solely to\ngive the Local Authority sufficient notice of claim\nagainst it so that it is not taken by surprise but has\nadequate time to prepare to deal with the matter in\nits defence. Its purpose is not to put hazards in the\nway of bringing litigation against it any more than\nthe requirement of Section 116(1) is to formulate\nin technical terms, the claim but to give notice of\nthe facts relied on for the claim, though not to\nestablish in his notice, a good cause of action.\"\nHerein, the question of what kind of\nnon-compliance will constitute a contravention of\nSection 11(2). Learned counsel has argued that it\ncould not have been intended by the statute that in\ncases where plaintiff acts, through solicitors or\nagents, the Corporation should be able to go over\nthe head of the Solicitors to deal with the plaintiff.\nIt was submitted that no lawful purpose is to be\n44\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n45/61\nfound in the\u00a0Section being conceived as requiring\nthe address of the client as well as that of the\nagent solicitors.\nWith due respect to learned counsel to the\nappellant, the provision of Section 11(2) is very\nclear and unambiguous on the issue. Whereas the\nfirst part of the provision relating to the giving of\nnotice explicitly provides that notice could be given\nby the intending plaintiff or his agent, the second\npart which prescribes the content of the notice is\nspecific with respect to the name and place of\nabode of the intending plaintiff. It did not include\nthat of his agent. The express mention of the name\nand place of abode of the intending plaintiff in the\nsecond part, excludes the possibility of the name\nand address of the agent as was done in the first\npart - The maxim expressio unius est exclusio\nalterius applies. The name and address of the agent\nhaving been excluded, only that of the intending\nplaintiff is required and is directory. The words are\nsufficiently clear and unambiguous and should be\ngiven their ordinary, grammatical meaning - See\nOwena Bank Nigeria Plc v. N.S.E. Ltd. (1997) 8\nNWLR (Pt.515) 1 . I agree with learned counsel to\nthe respondents that the expression cannot be\nstretched to include the name and address of his\nagent or solicitor.\nLearned counsel for the appellant urged on us the\nargument that the\u00a0Court should not accept a\nconstruction which results in the restriction of or\ncomplete taking away of a person's right of access\nto the\u00a0Courts. It was submitted that the adoption of\n45\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n46/61\nthe construction of\u00a0Section 11(2) suggested by\nrespondent has such effect.\nThe argument of counsel is founded on the exercise\nby the\u00a0Courts of the judicial powers of the\nconstitution vested in it. It also touches and\nconcerns the exercise by the legislature of its\nlegislative powers and the extent to which the\nlegislature can trench upon the exercise of judicial\npowers.\nThe exercise of the judicial powers of the\nConstitution provided in\u00a0Section 6(1) which is\nvested in the\u00a0Courts named, provides the scope of\nthe exercise in\u00a0Section 6(6)(b). It provides that-\n\"The judicial powers vested in accordance with the\nforegoing provisions of this\u00a0Section -\nxxx\n(b) shall extend to all matters between persons, or\nbetween government or authority and to any\nperson in Nigeria, and to all actions and\nproceedings relating thereto, for the determination\nof any question as to the civil rights and obligations\nof that person.\"\nThese provisions are complemented by Section\n36(1) of the Constitution which provides that:\n\"In the determination of his civil rights and\nobligations, including any question or\ndetermination by or against any government or\nauthority, a person shall be entitled to a fair\nhearing within a reasonable time by a\u00a0Court or\nother tribunal established by law and constituted in\nsuch manner as to secure its independence and\nimpartiality.\"\n46\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n47/61\nIt is clear that apart from the definition of the\nnature and extent of judicial powers, Section 6\ndoes not deal directly with the right of access to\nCourt. It is obvious that\u00a0Section 6 concerns itself\nwith the delimitation of the separation of powers\nbetween the judiciary and the other departments of\nthe Constitution.\nThe provision of Section 36(1) undoubtedly couched\nin wide absolute terms and is not unqualified. The\npurport of the provision is to enable right of access\nto the\u00a0Court absent legal obstacles in his path\nneutralising exercise of the right.

I have already\nreferred to the provisions of\nSection 11(2) of theNNPC Act, 1977.\nI have also analysed the\nprovisions as between the first part relating to\ngiving of the notice to the Corporation of the\nintention to bring the suit against it and the second\npart which prescribes the content of the notice.\nAlthough, it would seem that the provision\nregulates the commencement of actions against the\nCorporation without removing the adjudicatory\npowers of the\u00a0Court in respect of matters\nconcerning the Corporation or denying the\nindividual totally of the exercise of his right to\nCourt. These are legitimate purposes of pre-action\nnotice and are recognised procedure provisions. As\nwas stated in\nNgelegla v. Tribal authority, NongowaChiefdom\n(1953) 14WACA 325 at 327,\nsuch\u00a0provisions are to give the defendant \"breathing\ntime so as to enable him to determine whether he\nshould make reparation to the plaintiff.\"\nIn the recent decision of this\u00a0Court in\nAtolagbe v.Awuni\n(1997) 9 NWLR (Pt.522) 536 , a split decision\nof 5:2 held that\nSection 15 of the Chiefs(Appointment and Deposition) Law of Kwara State,as amended by Edict No.3 of 1988\nwhich provided\nthat a condition precedent to the payment of a\nnon-refundable fee of N10,000 to the Accountant-\nGeneral of the State to the institution of an action\nby a person aggrieved by a decision of the\nGovernor or other appointing authority in a\n48\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n49/61\nchieftaincy matter where an appointment has been\nmade, is not inconsistent with the provisions of\nSection 6(6)(b). It was held that\nSection 15 of Edict No.3 of 1988\ndid not curtail the right of a person to\nsue in a chieftaincy matter. It is merely a condition\nprecedent which must be fulfilled before an action\ncan be instituted. This\u00a0and\u00a0similar\u00a0decisions\u00a0of\u00a0this\nCourt\u00a0which\u00a0have\u00a0held\u00a0that\u00a0a\u00a0pre-action\u00a0notice\u00a0is\nnot\u00a0inconsistent\u00a0with\nSection\u00a06(6)\u00a0(b)\u00a0of\u00a0the Constitution\n\u00a0should\u00a0not\u00a0be\u00a0taken\u00a0to\u00a0mean\u00a0that\u00a0in\ncertain\u00a0circumstances,\u00a0the\u00a0particular\u00a0requirement\ncan\u00a0never\u00a0constitute\u00a0infringement\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0exercise\u00a0of\njudicial\u00a0\u00a0powers\u00a0by\u00a0the Courts\u00a0or\u00a0\u00a0abridge\u00a0the\ncitizen's\u00a0right\u00a0of\u00a0access\u00a0to\u00a0the Court.\u00a0Such\u00a0last\nmentioned\u00a0situations\u00a0will\u00a0definitely\u00a0be\u00a0inconsistent\nwith the Constitution.\nIn the same decision, a\ncondition precedent was defined as one which\ndelays the vesting of a right until the happening of\nan event. Section 11(2) NNPC Act, 1977 has\nprescribed the conditions for commencing actions\nagainst the Corporation. If the rationale behind the\nprovision as accepted is to give the Corporation\nbreathing time so as to enable it to determine\nwhether it should make reparation to the plaintiff,\nthe importance of strict compliance with the\nprovisions prescribing the name and address of the\nplaintiff as against the guaranteed right of access to\nthe\u00a0Court enshrined in Section 36(1) read together\nwith Section 6(6)(b) of the Constitution becomes of\ncritical importance.\nAccess to the\u00a0Court means\napproach or means of approach to the\u00a0Court without\nconstraint.\n49\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n50/61\nIn\u00a0my\u00a0opinion,\u00a0a\u00a0legitimate\u00a0regulation\u00a0of\u00a0access\u00a0to\nCourts\u00a0should\u00a0not\u00a0be\u00a0directed\u00a0at\u00a0impeding\u00a0ready\naccess\u00a0to\u00a0the Courts.\u00a0There\u00a0is\u00a0no\u00a0provision\u00a0in\u00a0the\nconstitution\u00a0for\u00a0special\u00a0privileges\u00a0to\u00a0any\u00a0class\u00a0or\ncategory\u00a0of\u00a0persons.\u00a0Any\u00a0statutory\u00a0provision\u00a0aimed\nat\u00a0the\u00a0protection\u00a0of\u00a0any\u00a0class\u00a0of\u00a0persons\u00a0from\u00a0the\nexercise\u00a0\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0the \u00a0Court\u00a0\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0its\u00a0\u00a0constitutional\njurisdiction\u00a0to\u00a0determine\u00a0the\u00a0right\u00a0of\u00a0another\ncitizen\u00a0\u00a0seems\u00a0\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a0me\u00a0\u00a0inconsistent\u00a0\u00a0with\u00a0\u00a0the\nprovisions\u00a0of\u00a0Section\u00a06(6)(b)\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Constitution.\nThe complaint of the non-compliance with any of\nthe prescribed contents of the notice under Section\n11(2) is not that no notice has been served. It is\nthat the notice is defective. Hence substantial\ncompliance could have been made enabling the\nCorporation to decide the course of its action viz-a-\nviz the suit. It will be inequitable to regard such a\nsituation as equivalent to absence of notice. If it is\notherwise, a situation has now been erected of an\nunnecessary and improper legal impediment to\naccess to\u00a0Court inconsistent with the constitutional\nrights of the\u00a0Courts under\u00a0Section 6(6)(b) and of\nthe citizen under\u00a0Section 36(1 ).\nI agree with learned counsel to the appellant that\nthe omission to state the name and address of the\nintending plaintiff cannot be an essential\nprecondition for commencing an action against the\nCorporation where a solicitor or agent is required\nfor service. These are particulars which are sine\nqua non of an action. For a non-compliance of\nSection 11(2) to be sufficient to deprive the\u00a0Court of\nits jurisdiction, the condition should be such as to\n50\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n51/61\nmake it difficult for the Corporation to make its\nchoice whether to settle with the plaintiff. Any\nother non-compliance is in-substantial and should\nnot deprive the\u00a0Court the exercise of its\nconstitutional jurisdiction or deny the plaintiff\naccess to the\u00a0Courts on the facts before the\u00a0Court.\nThere is no basis for a denial of access to the\nCourts. The mere omission to provide the address of\nthe residence of the plaintiff should not be fatal to\nthe claim.\nLearned counsel to the respondent has submitted\nthat the question whether S. 11(2) is inconsistent\nwith S.6(6)(b) of the Constitution was not\ncanvassed in the\u00a0Courts below and did not arise\nfrom any of the grounds of appeal filed. This\nargument ignores the scope of the interpretation of\nthe amplitude of the words of the provision. The\neffect of interpretation is to give meaning to the\nwords used within its legal milieux. It is not\nfar-fetched to employ constitutional provisions to\njustify the issue of access vel non to the\u00a0Courts\ndenied by a particular provision.\nBesides, it is well settled that any issue concerning\nthe jurisdiction of the\u00a0Court can be raised at any\nstage of the proceedings or on appeal. This is a\nmatter affecting the exercise of the jurisdiction. It\nis properly raised before us.\nI shall now consider the third issue for\ndetermination which is whether lack of knowledge\nof the appellant's abode was the basis for the\ndecision of the Court of Appeal.\nI have already discussed this issue in this\n51\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n52/61\njudgment. I agree with the submission of learned\ncounsel to the respondent that it could not be\nconclusively inferred from the judgment of the\nCourt of Appeal that lack of knowledge of\nappellant's place of abode was the basis of the\ndecision of the Court. It is clear that it was satisfied\nthat Exhibit \"B'' did not comply with the provisions\nof\u00a0Section 11(2) of the NNPC Act, 1977. It reached\nthis conclusion after examining the findings of the\nlearned trial Judge and agreeing with him. It is\nclear from the judgments of the\u00a0Courts below that\nno particular item of the preconditions prescribed in\nSection 11(2) was relied upon for determining the\nquestion of non-compliance.\nThe consideration of the second issue which\nconcerns substantive issues is to me unnecessary.\nThe\u00a0Court having determined the invalidity of\nExhibit \"B\", and that the\u00a0Court lacked the necessary\njurisdiction, it is therefore irrelevant and\nunnecessary to decide whether appellant suffered\nany miscarriage of justice because of the failure to\npronounce on whether the Notice contemplated by\nSection 11(2) applied to suits for breach of contract\nof employment.-\nHowever, I proceed to discuss the issue in the\ninterest of completeness. The cardinal question is\nwhether appellant suffered any miscarriage of\njustice because of this error. I shall rely on the\ndefinition of \"miscarriage of justice\" by Lord\nThankerton in the Privy Council decision of\nDevi v. Roy\n(1946) AC. 508, where his Lordship said that it\nis: \" ...such a departure from the rules which\n52\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n53/61\npermeate all judicial procedure as to make that\nwhich happened not in the proper sense of the\nword judicial procedure at all.\"\nAgain, in the United States decision of\nAlcorn v. Davies\n343 P. 2d. 621, 625-6, Vandyke P.1,\nadopted the test applied in People v. Watson 292,\nP2d, 243 where it was said;\n\" ...A miscarriage of justice should be declared only\nwhen the\u00a0Court, after an examination of the entire\ncase. including the evidence, is of the opinion that\nit is reasonably probable that a result more\nfavourable to the appealing party would have been\nreached in the absence of the error.\"\nIt seems to me that not all errors result in\nmiscarriage of justice. There is miscarriage of\njustice only where there are substantial errors in\nadjudication. With the resultant effect that the\nparty relying on such errors may likely have a\njudgment in his favour. As I have already stated,\nsince the suit has been determined in limine and as\na threshold issue, without discussion of the merits\nof the action, the determination of the question\nwhether\u00a0Section 11(2) of the NNPC Act. 1977\napplied to contract between the parties is\nunnecessary.\nI should state that the ipsissima verba of\nSection 11(2)\naffords absolute protection to the Corporation\n- See Fawehinmi Construction Co. Ltd. v. O.A.U.\n(1998) 6 NWLR (Pt.553) 171. The expression \"No\nSuit\" in Section 11(2) NNPC Act. 1977, has been\nconstrued in\nSection 46(1)of the University of Ife Edict\nas wide and all embracing. It was construed\n53\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n54/61\nas covering all suits and whatever causes of action\nand not limited to anything done pursuant to any\nAct or Statute. It relates to all or any type of\naction. It is wider and different in application from\nSection 97 of the Ports Authority Act. - See NPA v.\nConstruzioni Generali (1974) 12 SC. 81; Katsina\nLocal Authority v. Makudawa (1971) 1NMLR 100.\nThe question of the nature of the action would not\nhave made any difference to the decision. It is\nobvious that appellant did not suffer any\nmiscarriage of justice because the\u00a0Court below\nfailed to discuss the issue whether the notice\ncontemplated by\u00a0Section 11(2) NNPC Act. 1977\napplied to suits in breach of contract of\nemployment.\nFor the reasons, I have given in this judgment that\nthe non-compliance with\u00a0Section 11(2) of the NNPC\nAct, 1977 by the mere omission to state the home\naddress of the plaintiff is not sufficiently substantial\nto deprive the plaintiff his constitutional right of\naccess to the\u00a0Court under Section 36 and the\u00a0Courts\nof the exercise of their jurisdiction under\u00a0Section\n6(6)(b) of the 1979 Constitution. I will accordingly\nallow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the\nCourt below. The case is accordingly remitted to the\nHigh Court of Lagos State to be heard before\nanother Judge other than Silva J. Appellant is\nentitled to the costs of this appeal which I assess at\nNI0,000.\nUTHMAN\u00a0MOHAMMED, J.S.C.: I entirely agree with my\nLord, the Chief Justice that Exhibit B satisfied the\n54\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n55/61\nrequisite notice which is a precondition to filing any\nsuit against the N.N.P.C.\nIt is my view that Section 11(2) of Nigerian\nNational Petroleum Corporation Act, 1977 is not\ncontrary to\u00a0Section 6(6) of the Constitution. Section\n11(2) of the Act provides:\n\"No suit shall be commenced against the\nCorporation before the expiration of a period of one\nmonth after written notice of intention to\ncommence the suit shall have been served upon\nthe Corporation by the intending plaintiff or his\nagent; and the notice shall clearly and explicitly\nstate the cause of the action, the particulars of the\nclaim, name and place of abode of the intending\nplaintiff and the relief which he claims\".\nThe wordings of\u00a0Section 11(2) of N.N.P.C.

This\u00a0Court had held in Atolagbe v.\nAwuni (supra) that the Kwara State Edict No.3 of\n1988 which directed for payment of N10,000.00 as\na condition precedent to instituting an action in\nchieftaincy matters in Kwara State is not contrary\nto the provisions of\u00a0Section 6(6)(b) of 1979\nConstitution.\nIn Bright v. E.D. Lines Ltd. & Anor. (1952)20NLR 79\nAdemola J. (as he then was), dealt with an issue of\nfailure to give the statutory notice before filing suit\nagainst E.D. Lines Ltd. as was provided by Section\n40(2) of the Railway Ordinance, Cap. 191. The\nlearned judge in that case held as follows:\n\"There might have been some weight in that\nargument if the Ordinance had merely enacted that\nit should be brought to the notice of the Railway\nAdministration that an action would be brought\nagainst it. But it is clear that it is not mere\nknowledge but a proper notice in accordance with\nthe\u00a0Section of the Ordinance that is required. The\nwording of the Ordinance is clear enough as to who\n56\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n57/61\nmust be served and the method of service.\"\nAlso, another relevant authority is the decision of\nthis\u00a0Court in the case of Katsina Local Authority v.\nAlhaji Barmo Makudawa (1971) I NMLR 100 which\nhas been referred to by both counsel in this appeal.\nIn that case,a judgment was given by Katsina\nUpper Area Court against the Katsina Local\nAuthority in a suit in which Alhaji Barmo Makudawa\nclaimed 'a332,152,105 being the cost of 105 cattle\nsold and delivered to Katsina Local Authority\nthrough its employee, Sarkin Shanu. Katsina Local\nAuthority appealed to the High Court,Kaduna\narguing inter alia, that by virtue of\u00a0Section 116(1)\nof Local Authority Law, the debt was statute barred\nand that by virtue of\u00a0Section 116(2), the\nproceedings of the trial\u00a0Court was a nullity. The\nHigh Court dismissed the appeal.\nOn further appeal to the Supreme Court, this\u00a0Court,\nPer Coker J.S.C., held that the proceedings (before\nthe Upper Area Court) did not come within the\ntypes of actions described in\u00a0Section 116(1) of the\nLocal Authority Law and as such, the competency of\nproceedings cannot be challenged on that score.\nThe learned Justice further held that the ground of\nappeal complaining that the proceedings\ncontravened the provisions of\u00a0Section 116(1) was\nmisconceived and must fail.\nAlthough Katsina Local Authority failed in its appeal\nbefore the Supreme Court, Coker J.S.C. dealt with\nthe submission of the Attorney-General of the\nNorth Central State, Mamman Nasir (as he then\nwas) that compliance with\u00a0\u00a0Section\u00a0116(2)\u00a0of\u00a0Local\n57\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n58/61\nAuthority Law was a pre-condition which was\nfundamental\nto jurisdiction as such non-\ncompliance with the\u00a0Sub-section would have the\neffect of nullifying the whole proceedings. This\nCourt agreed with the submission of the Attorney\nGeneral in the following words:\n\"We are clearly of the view that Section 116(2) of the Local Authority Law\u00a0prescribes a condition\nprecedent to the competence of any action\ncommenced against a Local Authority and that\ncompliance with the\u00a0Sub-section as a pre-condition\nof such competence. The\u00a0Sub-section requires such\nnotice as it therein prescribed to be served on the\nLocal Authority and stipulates that at least one\nmonth shall expire before the suit can be legally\ncommenced. It follows therefore, in our view, that\nwhere it is established that no such notice was\nserved or that the\u00a0Sub-section is not otherwise\ncomplied with, any suit commenced in\ncontravention of the provisions of the\u00a0Sub-section is\nwrongly commenced and should not be entertained\nby any\u00a0Court\".\nFor these reasons and the fuller reasons in the\njudgment of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, this appeal\nsucceeds and it is allowed. The ruling of the High\nCourt and the judgment of the\u00a0Court below\naffirming that ruling are both set aside. I abide by,\nall the consequential orders made in the lead\njudgment.\nALOYSIUS IYORGYER\u00a0KATSINA-ALU, J.S.C.: I have had the advantage\nof reading in draft, the judgment of my learned\n58\n5/8/25, 11:23 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n59/61\nbrother Uwais, CJN in this appeal.

The appellant appealed to the Supreme Court on the grounds that the election failed to\ncomply with the provisions of the Electoral Act, 2006 and on account of corrupt practices.\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:14 PM\nMUHAMMADU BUHARI v INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION and 4 OTHERS (SC 51/2008) [2008] NGS\u2026\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2008/9/eng@2008-12-12\n2/13\nHELD\nLeading judgment by\u00a0Niki Tobi, JSC; with I.L. Kutigi Chief Justice, A.I. Katsina-Alu, D. Musdapher, JJSC\nconcurring; W.S.N. Onnoghen, A.M. Mukhtar, G.A. Oguntade, JJSC dissenting\n1. Burden of proof\nThe burden of proof is not static. It fluctuates between the parties. The burden of first proving the\nexistence of a fact lies on the party against whom the judgment of the court could be given if no\nevidence were produced on either side. In other words, the onus\u00a0probandi\u00a0is on the party who\nwould fail if no evidence is given in the case. Thereafter, the second burden goes to the adverse\nparty. In the instant case, the burden of proving non-compliance with the Electoral Act lay with\nthe appellant. Per Tobi, JSC at 171.\n2. Effect of conducting an election with invalid ballot papers\nSection 45(2) of the Electoral Act 2006 had not been complied with. A valid election can not be\nconducted without valid ballot papers. Section 67 of the Electoral Act provided that ballot papers\nthat did not comply with the requirements of the Act cannot be used in any election. Per Kutigi,\nCJN at 261.\n3. Further burden to prove substantiality of non-compliance with Electoral Act\nThe appellants then had to prove that such non-compliance with the Electoral Act substantially\naffected the result of the election. The respondents could then satisfy the court that non-\ncompliance did not affect the outcome. Per Kutigi, CJN at 261.\nIf a petitioner proves non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act, he is only entitled\nto succeed if the court is satisfied that such non-compliance substantially affected the result of\nthe election. Per Kutigi, CJN at 261; Tobi, JSC at 171; Katsina-Alu, JSC at 265; Musdapher, JSC at\n268.\n4. Non-compliance with the Act, insufficient to invalidate election\nThe appellant had failed to prove that non-compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act had\nsubstantially affected the result of the election.\u00a0Buhari v Obasanjo\u00a0(2005) 13 NWLR (Part 900) 487\napproved and followed. Non-compliance with the Electoral Act, without more, was not sufficient\nto invalidate the election. Per Kutigi, CJN at 261; Per Tobi JSC at 171.\n5. Jurisdiction of the court on the propriety of serialisation of ballot papers\nThere was no basis for the lower court to have found that the propriety and correctness of the\nserialisation of the ballot papers had affected the outcome of the election. The Court lacked the\ncompetence or jurisdiction to make such a finding. Per Kutigi CJN at 261.\n6. Right of the president of Court of Appeal to make Practice Directions\nThe President of the Court of Appeal has the power to make Practice Directions under the Federal\nHigh Court (Civil Procedure) Rules for the purpose of regulating the practice and procedure of the\nElection Tribunals. Per Tobi, JSC at 171.\n7. Limits of Practice Directions\nAlthough the president of the Court of Appeal had the power to make Practice Directions, such\nPractice Directions had to be within the confines of the law. The witness depositions in\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:14 PM\nMUHAMMADU BUHARI v INDEPENDENT NATIONAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION and 4 OTHERS (SC 51/2008) [2008] NGS\u2026\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2008/9/eng@2008-12-12\n3/13\ncompliance with the Practice Directions were incompetent as they offended the provisions of\nsection 90(b) and (c) of the Evidence Act. Per Tobi, JSC at 171.\n8. Constitutional provisions prevail over Practice Directions\nIf there is a conflict between the Constitution and Practice Directions, the former shall prevail. So\ntoo, if there is a conflict between an enabling statute and Practice Directions. Per Tobi, JSC at 171.\n9. Inadmissible evidence cannot be cured by consent\nIt did not matter that inadmissible evidence was admitted by consent of the parties. The affidavits\ndid not meet the requirements of the law and were, therefore, inadmissible. Per Tobi, JSC 171;\nMusdapher, JSC at 268.\n10. Probative value of documents tendered under Practice Direction\nThe basic aim of tendering documents in bulk was to ensure the speedy hearing of election\npetitions .\u00a0.\u00a0. But that did not\u00a0ipso facto\u00a0permit the court to attach probative value to documents\nthat lacked such value .\u00a0.\u00a0. As the documents failed the test, the Court of Appeal was right in\nexpunging them. It cannot be said that the Court of Appeal did not evaluate the evidence. Per\nTobi, JSC at 171.\n11. Effect of court disregarding evidence\nIf the court does not make use of evidence of a witness, the evidence will be regarded as dead\nand moribund in the determination of the live issues. As the Court of Appeal did not place any\nprobative value on the evidence, the evidence is irrelevant. Per Tobi, JSC at 171.\n12. Power of court to test findings of Commission of Inquiry\nThe Court had the jurisdiction under section 239(1) of the Constitution to inquire into the validity\nof the report of the Commission of Inquiry (Exhibit EP2/34) purporting to disqualify the fourth and\nfifth respondents on grounds of fraud and embezzlement. Such exhibit was invalid and irrelevant.\nThe purported finding, therefore, did not disqualify the fourth respondent from contesting the\nelection. Per Kutigi, CJN at 261; Per Tobi JSC at 171.\n13. Meaning of criminal conviction\nAn indictment involves an allegation or commission of a crime which necessitates the drafting of a\ncharge. That is the essence of section 137(1)(i) of the Constitution. There is nothing in the findings\nof the Commission of Inquiry set up by the Governor of Abia State, to suggest that the fourth and\nfifth respondents were specifically found guilty of embezzlement or fraud, and so Exhibit EP2/34\ndid not articulate or vindicate section 137(1)(i) of the Constitution as it is clearly on its own.

In that election, the country is one constituency and it is the Presidential\nConstituency. The results were announced, two days later and precisely on 23 April 2007. The second\nrespondent, Professor Maurice Iwu, announced the results at a World Press Conference. He declared\nAlhaji Umaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua and Dr Goodluck Jonathan, the fourth and fifth respondents respectively\nas the winners. They were the fifth and sixth respondents in the Court of Appeal. Their families and\nsupporters jubilated. They were happy. The two candidates were happy too. They should be. They\ncontested the election and they won. There could not have been a happier moment in their lives at the\nmaterial time. In the results, Major General Muhammadu Buhari, ANPP, scored 6,605,291 votes. Alhaji\nUmaru Musa Yar\u2019Adua, PDP, scored 24,638,063 votes.\nWhile the fourth and fifth respondents were happy, the appellant was not happy. He rejected the\nresults. He felt that the election was inconclusive. He filed an election petition together with Chief Edwin\nUme-Ezoke, his running mate.

Soremekun (1963) ALL NLR\n349 where at page 351 this Court made the following observations:- \"It appears to us\nthat the power of this court under section 24 of the Act is in no way fettered by the fact\nthat a previous application to the High Court has been granted in the High Court; an\napplicant may, if he so desires, seek more favourable conditions in the Supreme Court,\nif he thinks the conditions laid down by the High Court are onerous or, for any other\nreason, are found unreasonable.\" Furthermore, the earlier dictum of Ademola CJN in\nBisi Oyeti V. Afolabi Soremekun (1963) 1 ALL NLR 349 at 350-351; is quite instructive\non the point in issue when he posited thus: \"It was argued that in accordance with\norder 7 Rule 37 (supra), an application of this nature can be made to this court only if a\nprevious application had been refused in the High court. As this is not the case here,\nthe submission is that in case of dissatisfaction of the order made in the High Court,\nthe Applicant may only appeal to this Court.\" We are of the view that whilst\nproceedings by way of appeal to this court may be a remedy in such cases, it is not the\nonly remedy. The provisions of section 24 of the Federal Supreme Court Act, dealing\nwith stay of execution, are worth of consideration. They state:- \"24. An appeal under\nthis part (i.e. in civil cases) shall not operate as a stay of execution, either\nunconditionally or upon the performance of such conditions as may be imposed in\naccordance with rules of Court.\" It appears to us that the power of this court under\nsection 24 of the Act is in no way fettered by the fact that a previous application to the\nHigh court has been granted in the High court; an applicant may, if he so desires, seek\nmore favourable conditions in the Supreme Court, if he thinks the conditions laid down\nby the High court are onerous or, for any other reason, are found unreasonable\".\nLearned counsel for the Respondent has rightly cited Solanke v. Somefun (1974) 1 S.C\n141 at 148; where per Sowemimo, JSC, emphasized on the need for Rules of court to\nbe obeyed or complied with and that any party or counsel seeking the exercise of the\nCourt's discretionary power, must bring his case within the purview of the Rules upon\nwhich the Application is predicated and that upon failure to do so, it is but fair and\nright that the Court should refuse to exercise her discretionary power in favour of such\na party. See also Owners of The M. V. \"Arabella\" v. Nigeria Agricultural Insurance\nCorporation (2008)5 SCNJ 109 at 120; cited by the learned counsel for the Respondent;\nAuto Import Export v. Adebayo (2003) 2 M.J.S.C 44 at 60; Ibodo v. Enarofia (1980) 5-7\nS.C 42 and Oforkire v. Maduike (2003) 5 NWLR (Pt. 812) at 181 para. C. However, the\nomission or error in stating the Rules under which the Application is brought\n(assuming there is any such omission which is not the case herein), is not such an\nirregularity which goes to the substance of the application so as to vitiate it as\npurported by the learned counsel for the Respondent. See per Tobi, JSC, who posited in\nAbubakar v. Yar'Adua (2008) 4 NWLR (pt. 1078) 467 at 510 paras. H, that as a matter of\nour adjectival law, and by the state of the noncompliance Rules, the Courts will regard\ncertain acts of conducts of noncompliance as mere irregularity which could be waived\nin the interest of Justice, (assuming the learned Senior Counsel for the\nAppellant/Applicant was wrong in citing Order 4 Rules 6 and 11 (which is not the case).\nFor instance Rule 6 of Order 4 of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2011 empowers the Court\nto make orders by injunctions or appointment of a Receiver or Manager, and such\nother necessary orders for the protection of property or person, pending the\ndetermination of an appeal to it, even though no application for such an order was\nmade in the lower Court. The application for unconditional stay of execution is such an\napplication envisaged by the Rule above cited. Again, the Learned Counsel for the\nRespondent cannot seriously contend that Rule 11 of Order 4 does not apply to the\nprayers sought in this Application. That Rule for instance charges and empowers the\nCourt to be seised of the whole proceedings between the parties once an appeal had\nbeen entered and until finally disposed of and except as otherwise provided by the\nRules, every Application therein shall be made to the Court and not to the Court below,\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:14 PM\nUNIVERSITY OF ILORIN TEACHING HOSPITAL v DR. DELE ABEGUNDE (CA/IL/M.60/2011) [2012] NGSC 4 (13 June 2012) -\u2026\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2012/4/eng@2012-06-13\n3/10\nbut any Application may be filed in the Court below for transmission to the Court.\nFrom the foregoing provisions, the Rules 6 and 11 cover this Application. Assuming\nhowever that the prayers in the motion are not covered by the afore-stated Rules, let it\nbe emphasized for the umpteenth time, that the era of strict and slavish adherence to\ntechnical and mechanical Rules of procedure, is gone for good as Courts nowadays are\nmore disposed to doing substantial justice. This position of the Law is encapsulated in\nOrder 4 Rule 6 and more particularly Order 20 Rules 2 and 3(1) which provides that the\nCourt may direct a departure from the Rules in anywhere this is required in the interest\nof justice. Furthermore, the Court may, in exceptional circumstances, and where it\nconsiders it in the interest of justice so to do, waive compliance with the Rules or any\npart thereof. The above provisions of the Rules, is the essence of the dictum of Tobi,\nJSC, in Abubakar v. Yar'Adua (supra) at 511 paras E.G; that although Rules of Court are\nmeant to be obeyed for that is why they were made, they should not be slavishly\nobeyed to the extent that justice in the case is asphyxiated, muzzled, destroyed and\njettisoned over-board for the barometer for measuring a judicial process by the public\nis whether justice has been done to the parties, therefore his Lordship had admonished\nthe Courts to do justice even if some harm is done to some procedural Rule like the\none canvassed. See again Orient Bank (Nig) Plc. v. Bilante International Ltd. (1997) 8\nNWLR (pt 155) Per Tobi, JCA, (as he then was) explaining the purport of the provision of\nOrder 19 Rules 2 and 3(2) of the Court of Appeal Rules which were in pari materia with\nOrder 20 Rules 2 and 3(1) of the current Court of Appeal Rules, 2011. On the whole, the\nsubmission of the learned Counsel to the Respondent on the preliminary point, is\nerroneous in that by the provisions of Sections 15 and 17 of the Court of Appeal Act\nalone, the Application is competent and can be sustained if the legal requirements are\nfulfilled. This takes us to the substance of the Application. It would appear that the\nlearned Counsel on both sides of the divide are ad idem and the learned Senior\nAdvocate has rightly cited the locus classicus of Vaswani Trading Company v. Savalakh\n& Company (1972) 12 SC 77 at 81-82 wherein Coker, JSC (as he then was), stated the\nlaw in these words:- \"When the order or Judgment of a lower Court is not manifestly\nillegal or wrong, it is right for a Court of Appeal to presume that the order or Judgment\nappealed against is correct or rightly made until the contrary is proved or established\nand for this reason the Court, and indeed any Court, will not make a practice of\ndepriving a successful litigant of the fruits of his success unless under very special\ncircumstances. (See in this connection the observations of Bowen L.J. in The Annot Lyle\n(1886) 11 P. 114 at P. 116). We take it that the word \"special\" in this context is not used\nin antithesis to the words \"common\" or \"normal\" for that would be tantamount to pre-\njudging the appeal on a determination of an application for stay of execution. When it\nis stated that the circumstances or conditions for granting a stay should be special or\nstrong we take it as involving a consideration of some collateral circumstances and\nperhaps in some cases inherent matters which may, unless the order for stay is\ngranted, destroy the subject-matter of the proceedings or foist upon the Court,\nespecially the Court of Appeal, a situation of complete hopelessness or render\nnugatory any order or orders of the Court of Appeal or Appeal or paralyse, in one way\nor the other, the exercise by the litigant of his constitutional right of appeal or\ngenerally provide a situation in which whatever happens to the case, and in particular\neven if the Appellant succeeds in the Court of Appeal, there will be no return to the\nstatus quo.\" The respective learned counsel for the parties have also rightly enunciated\nposition of the law on the principles informing the grant or refusal of an Application for\nstay and in particular the learned counsel for the Respondent has hit the nail on the\nhead when he posited citing the authority of SPDC v. Arho-Joe (Nig.) Ltd. (2003) FWLR\n(pt.184) 307 at 314 and Governor of Oyo State v. Akinyemi (2002) FWLR (pt. 120) 1761\nat 1772; to submit that the grant of the application calls for the judicious and judicial\nexercise of the Court's discretion predicated on the juxtaposition of the competing\n\u25b2 To the top\n5/7/25, 1:14 PM\nUNIVERSITY OF ILORIN TEACHING HOSPITAL v DR.

As I said elsewhere in University of Ilorin v. Adesina (2008) All\nFWLR (Pt. 400) 709 at 726-730; particularly at page 727 paras. D-H and 728 paras. A-H;\nthe factors to be taken into consideration before a Court can grant or refuse an\nApplication of this sort have been the subject of decisions in a welter of cases within\nour jurisprudence. Suffice it to say however, by way of emphasis that (see for instance\nthe case of Vaswani Trading & Co. Ltd. v. Savalakh & co. (supra); Wey V. Wey (1975) 1\nSC. 1 and Odufuye v. Fatoke (1975) 1 NMLR 222); the Court does not form the habit of\ndepriving a successful litigant of the fruits of his Judgment and thus seldom grants a\nstay of execution of the Judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction which is always\npresumed to be sacrosanct until set aside by the court of Appeal. Thus, until the\nApplicant, as in this case, has been able to show special and exceptional circumstances,\nthis court even in its appellate jurisdiction cannot deprive the Plaintiff/Respondent\nalbeit momentarily of the fruits of her victory. Generally speaking, the basic factors to\nbe taken into consideration in granting or refusing an Application for stay of execution\nof a Judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction are as follows: 1. There must be the\nexistence of a valid appeal. See Mobil Oil Ltd. v. Agadiagho (1988) 4 SCNJ 174 and\nMartin v Nicanner Food Co. Ltd. (1988) 2 NWLR (Pt. 74) 75. 2. The Grounds of appeal\nmust be substantial and weighty and raise recondite point of law which are capable of\ntilting a scale of justice one way or the other. See Ajomale v. Yaduat (No. 2) (2003)\nFWLR (Pt. 182) 1913 at 1935; Balogun v. Balogun (1969) 1 All NLR 349 at 351. 3.\nConduct of the parties it has been held that since stay of execution is an equitable\nrelief the parties must come with clean hands and in particular the Applicant must not\nbe blame-worthy either in his previous and present conduct to the Court and other\nparties to the case in the manner of the presentation of his application. See Momah v.\nVAB Petroleum Incorporated (2000) FWLR (Pt 5) 806 S.C; Ikeja Real Estate Ltd. v. N.B.N.\nLtd. (2000) FWLR (Pt. 9) 1448 C.A and A.G Anambra State v. Onitsha North Local\nGovernment (2001) FWLR (pt. 45) 622; where the Supreme Court in spite of the weighty\ngrounds of the appeal refused to grant the application for stay on the ground of the\nunpalatable conduct of the Applicant. 4. Existence of special circumstances and the\nneed to protect the res - the term \"special circumstance\" may include: (a) Where the\nGround of appeal is such that if the appeal eventually succeeds after the refusal of stay,\nan irreparable damage, injury or injustice shall have been occasioned such that there\ncan be no return to the status quo ante; See Dr. Dada v. Unilag (1971) UILR 344; Utilgas\nNigeria & Overseas Co. Ltd. v. Pan African Bank Ltd. (1974) 10 S.C. 105; (1974) 1 ALL\nNLR (pt.2) 47. (b) That the res shall have gone so that the successful party will reap an\nempty victory if the appeal is in his favour. See Wilson v. Church (No. 2) 1879 12 Ch. D.\n454 at 458 and Iriri v. Erharhobare (1979) 3 L.R.N 261; Vicent v. Xtodeus (1993) 6 SCNJ\n(Pt. 11) 283. (c) The need to prevent foisting a situation of complete hopelessness and\nhelplessness so as to render the Judgment of the Court of Appeal nugatory. See Kigo\n(Nig) Ltd. v. Holman Bros. (Nig) Ltd. (1980) 5-7 SC, 60; Fatoyinbo v. Osadenyi (2002) 5\nSCNJ 160 at 174 and Vaswani Trading Co., v. Savalakh Co., (Supra). (d) Finally, where the\nJudgment is in respect of money and costs there is a reasonable probability of\nrecovering these back from the Respondent if the Appeal succeeds. See Lawrence\nOgboeju Ebegbuna v. J. O. Ebegbuna (1974) 3 W.S.C.A. 29. Poverty is not a special\nground for granting the stay of execution except where the effect will be to deprive the\nAppellant of the ability to prosecute his appeal. Nwajekwu Emefisi & Ors v. Mbanugwo\n& Ors (1970-71) 1 ECSLR 100, Lijadu v. Lijadu (1991) 1 NWLR 627 at 643; Okafor V.\nNnaife (1987) 4 NWLR 139; Nwabueze v. Nwosu (1988) 4 NWLR 257 (S.C.). In recent\ntimes the Courts have held that the mere assertion by the Applicant that, if the\njudgment-debt is satisfied he cannot successively prosecute the appeal is not enough\nto warrant the grant of his application for stay of execution, so also will his assertion on\nthe enormity and substantiality of the debt not constitute special circumstance for the\ngrant of his application.

Indeed, as far\nas the grant of stay of execution of monetary Judgment is concerned I reiterate our\nstand in Unilorin v. Adesina (No. 7) (supra) at pages 727-728; quoting the illuminating\ndictum of Adekeye, JCA (as he then was) in Oladimeji-Ise-Oluwa Ltd. v. N.D. Ltd. (2001)\n18 WRN 28 at 36-37 that: \"In a judgment involving money the terms upon which the\nCourt would grant a stay are easier to determine than in other judgments where the\nres is perishable or prone to alteration. The terms-are-briefly stated thus: 1. Whether\nmaking the applicant to satisfy the judgment would make his financial position such\nthat he could not prosecute the appeal. 2. Whether it would be difficult to secure the\nrefund of the judgment/debt and costs from the respondent if the appeal succeeds.\nFor this purpose, the financial ability of the respondent is taken into account-\nConsiderations in favour of the respondent are as follows:- (a) The fact that the\nrespondent is entitled to reap the fruits of the judgment for that is the whole essence\nof litigation. (b) The court has a duty to ensure that the successful party reaps the\nbenefit of his successful litigation. (c) The applicant seeking to deprive a successful\nlitigant of the fruit of his labour must show substantial reasons why the court must\ngrant the application\".

But in order to properly\nexercise that discretion, it does not as rule have to base it on matters of defence of law\nor relief in equity which themselves in appropriate circumstances must be raised in the\naction itself. There must be special circumstances disclosed by the applicant seeking\nstay which render it inexpedient to enforce the judgment. The special circumstances\nwhich the court will take into account to entitle it to a stay of execution of the\njudgment are, as a general rule, such circumstances which go to the enforcement of\nthe judgment and not those which go merely to its correctness....\" Per OGBUINYA,\nJ.C.A.

The Appellant/Applicant has appealed against the Judgment of the Federal High Court, Ilorin\nDivision.\n\"ii. The Judgment Sum is considerable and if execution is levied against the Defendant it might become\ndifficult to recover the Judgment Sum.\n\"iii. In such circumstances, the appeal might be rendered nugatory if execution is levied.\"\nIn support of the Application, the Applicant through one of her counsel Olusegun Balogun Esq.\ndeposed to a twenty-five paragraph affidavit to which three Exhibits marked OB1, OB2 and OB3 are\nannexed. Exhibit OB1 is the Judgment of the lower Court sought to be appealed against herein, Exhibit\nOB2 is the Notice and Grounds of appeal already filed in this Court, while Exhibit OB3 is the Ruling of\nthe lower Court granting conditional stay of execution of the Judgment per A.O Faji, J. of the Federal\nHigh Court, Ilorin Division.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Upon being served with the Motion Papers, the Respondent in opposing the motion filed a\nCounter-affidavit of twenty-three paragraphs deposed to by Abiodun Bello Esq. also a legal practitioner\nin the firm of Dayo Akinlaja & Co.; the learned counsel to the Judgment Creditor/Respondent. Owing to\nthe contentious nature of the Application, parties were ordered by this Honourable Court to file their\nWritten Addresses in support of their respective positions on the merit or demerit of the Application.\nBefore delving into the arguments adumbrated in the respective Addresses of counsel, it is necessary to\nstate the genesis of the case culminating in this Application. The Respondent as Claimant in the lower\nCourt suing for himself and on behalf of the family of Ernest Omotade Abegunde (deceased), instituted\nan action at the Federal High Court Ilorin claiming the sum of 20 Million Naira as Special damages and\nthe sum of 35 Million Naira as general damages for the untold agony emotional distress, travails and\ndeep trauma caused to him and other members of the family of the deceased on account of the\nnegligent treatment that resulted in the untimely and avoidable demise of the deceased.\nAfter hearing the parties to the suit the learned trial Judge entered judgment in favour of the\nRespondent for the sum of N3, 138,230.00 (Three Million, One Hundred and Thirty Eight Thousand, Two\nHundred and Thirty Naira only) as special damages.

A respondent who has an objection to the hearing of the petition\nshall file his reply and state the objection therein and the objection shall be heard along with the substantive petition.\" Paragraph 53 (5) of the same\nschedule to the Electoral Act on the other hand provides thus: \"(5) An objection challenging the irregularity or competence of an election petition shall be\nheard and determined after the close of pleadings.\" It is now trite law that election petitions are sui generis that is, that they are in class of their own and\nare governed by different rules. An election petition is by nature a very peculiar proceeding which distinguishes it from an ordinary civil proceeding. See\nAbubakar v. Yar'adua (2008) 19 NWLR (Pt 1120) 1. In Nwole v. Iwuagwu (2004) 15 NWLR (Pt 895) 61 the Court, held thus: \"The Courts have often harped on the\nneed to do substantial justice in most cases without dwelling too much on technicalities ... in all election matters, the use of technicalities should be\navoided, as technicalities merely help to shut the opponent out. It never resolves basic issues in controversy. Once it is agreed that election petitions are in\na class of their own, the handling of the matter too must take a form devoid of legal technicalities that tend to leave the litigants more confused. Boldness\nof a high degree is required of the electoral tribunal, which must never be seen to shy away from obvious grave allegations.\" When paragraph 53 (5) was in\nbeing paragraph 12 (5) came in on the 29th October, 2010 like a Trojan Horse. Paragraph 53 (5) itself came into effect on 20th August, 2010. Paragraph 12\n(5) was undoubtedly enacted for a purpose. That purpose was to enable election petition tribunals to handle election petitions without undue reliance on\ntechnicalities. Although paragraph 53 (5) was not repealed, the law is that the provisions of the later enactment amend the earlier so far as necessary to\nremove the inconsistency between them. See Akintokun v LPDC (2014) 5 SCM 1, Ogbunaya v. Akudo (1979) 6-9 SC 32 and DPP v INEC (1999) 11 NWLR (pt\n626) 200. Paragraph 53 (5) is now impliedly repealed by paragraph 12 (5). By paragraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule to the Electoral Act an objection to the\nhearing of a petition is authorized to be raised in the Respondents reply to the petition. Learned counsel for the Appellant thinks the position is rather fluid\nwhen the challenge to the competence or regularity of the election petition is not contained in the reply but is brought by way of motion on notice. I see no\ndifficulty here. If it is a challenge to the tribunal hearing the petition whether the objection is stated in the reply or is brought by motion on notice, the\ntribunal has jurisdiction to hear it along with the substantive petition. Paragraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule to the Electoral Act is intended to reflect the sui\ngeneris nature of election petitions. The mischief it intends to cure is to ensure that objections raised do not derail the determination of the merit of a case\nby undue and unwarranted delay occasioned by the preliminary objection. See Oke & ors v. Mimiko & ors (2013) 9 SCM 155 and PDP v. INEC (2012) 7 NWLR\n(Pt 1130) 538. I am of the view that although the Appellant filed two motions on notice apart from the objections incorporated in his reply the Tribunal\nrightly invoked the provision of paragraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule to the Electoral Act 2010 when it decided to take the preliminary objections along\nwith the substantive petition.\"\nAPPEAL - APPEAL AS OF RIGHT - At what point will an appeal lie as of right from the decisions of the Election Tribunals\n\"The main grouse of the 1st and 2nd Respondents in their preliminary objection is that the grounds of appeal are of mixed law and fact which require the\nleave of this Court and no such leave has been sought or granted. The 1st and 2nd Respondents in a recent appeal NO: CA/EPT/GOV/203/14 raised a similar\nobjection. This Court in its judgment delivered by Owoade JCA on 14th November, 2014 overruled the objection because the objection did not affect the\ncompetence of the Appellant's Notice of Appeal. This is what the Court at page 8 - 9 of the unreported judgment stated: \"For example, Section 246 (1) (b)\n(ii) of the 1999 Constitution as amended truly gives a leeway to the Appellant to file an appeal on any decision (including interlocutory) decisions of a\nGubernatorial election tribunal. Thus, in the case of Awuse v. Odili (2003) 18 NWLR (pt. 851) 116 at 119, Ejiwunmi JSC supported the lead judgment of I.L.\nKutugi JSC quoted the provision of Section 246 (1) (b) (ii) of the 1999 Constitution as amended and said of the Section as follows: \"An appeal to the Court of\nAppeal shall lie as of right from the decision of the Governorship Election Tribunal on any question as to whether any person has been validly elected to the\noffice of Governor\".\"Though the word \"any\" when used as an adjective is defined in Longman Dictionary of the English Language thus: \"One or some\nindiscriminately, whichever is chosen\". It would appear that the word \"any\" qualifying \"question\" was deliberately used by the law makers to indicate that an\nappeal to the Court of Appeal was not limited only to hearing appeals only to whether any person has been validly elected to the office of Governor ... It\nfollows therefore that the provisions of Section 246 (1) allows appeals to lie to Court of Appeal in respect of interlocutory decision of the Governorship\nElection Tribunals and the other tribunals named in that Section of the Constitution\" . Also in the case of Maduako V Onyejiocha (2009) 5 NWLR (pt. 1134)\n259 at 280, the Court of Appeal Per Eko JCA held as follows:-\"By way of emphasis, I wish to add that the decision of the Supreme Court in Alhaji Atiku\nAbubakar & Ors V. Alhaji Umaru Musa Yar'Adua & Ors SC 288/2007 of 25th January, 2008 (reported in (2008) 4 NWLR (pt. 1078) 465 Per Niki Tobi JSC, leave\nno doubt in me that an aggrieved party has right of appeal against an interlocutory decision of an election tribunal. That right is a constitutional right by\ndint of Section 246 (1) (b) of the 1999 Constitution, which is in Pari materia with Section 233 (2) (3) of the Constitution under which Atiku V. Yar'Adua case\nwas decided\". From the above authorities, it becomes clear that the Appellant has a constitutional right to appeal without leave of Court on any\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/31\ninterlocutory decision of a Governorship Election Tribunal and that put paid to the objection by the Respondents that the Appellant needed to have sought\nleave of the tribunal or this Court on his grounds of appeal on questions of mixed law and facts.\"\nELECTION PETITION - ELECTION PETITION PROCEEDINGS - Whether an election petition tribunal can hear an objection along with the substantive\npetition\n\"I do agree with the Learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents that the provisions of Paragraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule are inconsistent with the\nearlier provision of Paragraph 53 (5) but by implication amends the earlier so far as is necessary to remove the inconsistency between them. Indeed,\nParagraph 12 (5) stipulates that a Respondent who has an objection to the hearing of the petition shall file his reply and state the objection, which will be\ndetermined with the substantive petition. The phrase \"hearing the petition\" cannot be limited to only after pleadings have been exchanged, Paragraph 12 (5)\nof the 1st Schedule is intended from its composition to reflect the sui generis nature of election matters. The mischief obviously is to ensure objections\nraised do not derail the determination of the merit of a case by undue and unwarranted delay occasioned by the preliminary objection. Oke & Ors v Mimiko\n& Ors (2013) 9 SCM 155 at 177; P.D.P. v INEC (2012) 7 NWLR (pt. 1130) 538 at 559.To this extent, the contention of the Appellant in the instant case based on\nthe authority of Nwankwo V. Yar'Adua (2010) 12 NWLR (pt. 1209) 518 at 589 is not applicable because the provisions of Paragraph 12 (5) was not considered\nin the case of Nwankwo V. Yar'Adua (supra).\"\nELECTION PETITION - ELECTION PETITION PROCEEDINGS - Whether an election petition tribunal can hear an objection along with the substantive\npetition\n\"I agree that the provision of Paragraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule to the Electoral Act, 2010 is a special provision that has been put into our Electoral\npractice adjudicatory law, to ensure that electoral contests are heard on their merit and expeditiously without any unnecessary delay thereby, election\nappeals, being a sui generis appeal. There is nothing untoward in taking preliminary objections or motions along with the substantive appeals as relating to\nthe resolution thereof. This well trodden path had been taken by this Court in ALL Progressives Congress V. Senator Iyiola Omisore: Appeal\nNo.CA/AK/EPT/Gov/203/2014 delivered in November, 2014 (unreported) relying on the cases of Oke & Ors v. Mimiko & Ors (2013) 9 SCM 155; PDP v. INEC\n(2012) 7 NWLR Pt. 11. 30, Page 638.\"\nJUDGEMENT SUMMARY\nINTRODUCTION:\nThis appeal borders on Election Petition.\nFACTS:\nThe appeal was filed against the decision of the Governorship Election Tribunal holden at Osogbo.\nThe Appellant brought two applications before the Tribunal. The first, a Notice of Preliminary Objection brought pursuant to paragraph 4 (1) of the first schedule to the\nElectoral Act 2010, challenged the Tribunal's competence to hear the petition as the 1st and 2nd Respondents lacked the locus standi to present the petition having\nfailed to indicate in the petition that they had the right to present the petition as required by paragraph 4 (1) and (2) of the First Schedule to the Electoral Act 2010 (as\namended). The second one was a Motion for striking out and dismissal order.\nOn the 30th day of October, 2014, the Tribunal commenced pre-hearing sessions and the two applications came up for hearing when the 1st and 2nd Respondents\n(petitioners) orally applied that the Appellants preliminary objections be heard together with the petition. This application was opposed by the Appellant and the 3rd\nRespondent. However, the Tribunal granted the prayer of the 1st and 2nd Respondents in its Ruling wherein their lordships of the Tribunal ruled that the said\napplications shall be heard with the petition and ruling shall be delivered at the end of trial.\nDissatisfied with the ruling, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal.\nISSUES:\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n4/31\nThe Court adopted the issue formulated by the 1st and 2nd Respondents in the determination of the appeal. The issues is:\n\"Whether the Lower Tribunal was right when it held that Appellant's applications dated 16th October, 2014 and 21st October, 2014 will be taken along with the petition.\"\nDECISION/HELD:\nIn the final analysis, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.\nJAMES SHEHU ABIRIYI, J.C.A. (Delivering the\nLeading Judgment): This is an appeal against the\nruling of the Governorship Election Petition\nTribunal sitting at Osogbo delivered on the 4th\nNovember, 2014. The Appellant who is\nthe 1st Respondent in the petition by\nmotion on notice dated 16th October,\n2014 challenged the competence of the Tribunal to\nhear the petition because the petitioner had not\nindicated in the petition that he had a right to\npresent the petition as required by Paragraph 4 (1)\nand (2) of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\nThe Appellant also filed another motion on notice\non 21st October, 2014 praying for an order of the\nTribunal to strike out the petitioners' Reply to the\n1st Respondent's Reply same having been filed out\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n5/31\nof time and dismissing the petition, the Petitioners\nhaving failed to apply for issuance of Pre-hearing\nNotice as prescribed by Paragraph 18 (1) of the\nFirst Schedule to the Electoral Act 2010 (as\namended).\nOn 30th October, 2014 in the course of pre-hearing\nsession, learned counsel for the Petitioners referred\nthe Tribunal to the provision of Paragraph 12 (5) of\n5\nthe First Schedule to the Electoral Act 2010 (as\namended) and entreated the Tribunal to take the\nmotions/objections of the 1st Respondent/Appellant\nalong with the petition considering the fact that\nthere was time limitation for the hearing of election\npetitions. The tribunal in a considered ruling ruled\nthus:\n\"It is not a contested fact that time is of the\nessence in the determination of this petition.\nThe Tribunal has less than 4 months to\ndetermine this petition. There are over a\nthousand witnesses and numerous documents\nlisted by the parties. The Respondents have\nnot complained of any injustice or miscarriage\nthat would be occasioned to them if these two\nmotions are taken along with the petition. We\nhave also not seen any prejudice or\nmiscarriage of justice that will be caused to\nthe Respondents. It is in consideration of the\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n6/31\nabove, the interest of justice and the speedy\ntrial of this petition that we hereby order that\nall the 4 motions now pending in this petition\nshall be taken along with the petition.\"\nDissatisfied with the ruling, the Appellant filed a\nNotice of Appeal against it on 7th November, 2014.\nThe Notice of Appeal contains six grounds from\nwhich the Appellant presented the following issues\nfor determination:\n\"1. Whether the Tribunal was right in its\n6\ndecision to hear the Appellant's preliminary\nobjection of 16/10/2014 challenging the 1st\nand 2nd Respondents' locus standi to present\nthe Petition together with the Petition.\n(Ground 1 of the Notice of Appeal)\n2. Whether the Tribunal was right in its\ndecision to hear the preliminary objection of\nthe Appellant of 22/10/2014 together with\nthe Petition when the said preliminary\nobjection constitutes a challenge to the\njurisdiction of the Tribunal to further entertain\nthe Petition for failure of the 1st and 2nd\nRespondents to file for issuance of\npre-hearing sessions within time prescribed\nby law. (Grounds 2, 3 and 4 of the Notice of\nAppeal)\n3. Whether the Appellant must show what\ninjustice, prejudice or miscarriage of justice\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n7/31\nhe shall suffer before the Tribunal is obliged to\nhear and determine the Motion on Notice filed\non 21/10/2014. (Grounds 5 and 6 of the\nNotice of Appeal).\"\nThe 1st and 2nd Respondents formulated a lone\nissue for determination although they filed a notice\nof preliminary objection. The sole issue formulated\nby the 1st and 2nd Respondents is whether the\nLower Tribunal was right when it held that\nAppellant's applications dated 16th October, 2014\nand 21st October, 2014 will be taken along with\nthe petition.\n7\nArguing the appeal, it was the submission of\nlearned counsel for the Appellant that the Tribunal\nwas wrong in holding that the preliminary objection\nof 16th October, 2014 challenging the locus standi\nof the 1st and 2nd Respondents to present the\npetition should be heard together with the petition\nbecause Paragraph 12 (5) of the 1st\u00a0Schedule to\nthe Electoral Act deals only with objections included\nin the replies to petitions and not when same is\nbrought by way of motion on notice after close of\npleadings as in this case. Secondly, the appellant's\nmotion was brought under Paragraph 47 (1) which\nis separate and distinct from Paragraph 12 (5).\nIt was submitted that the objection raised in the\nReply was just an indication of the intention of the\nAppellant to challenge the locus standi of the\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/31\nPetitioners and the objection was properly raised by\nmotion on notice of 16/10/2014. That the Appellant\nhad made a choice to come by way of motion on\nnotice so that the issue of the locus standi of the\nPetitioners could be determined at the pre-hearing\nsession. It was submitted that the decision of the Tribunal to hear the motions together with the petition violated Paragraph 53 (5) of the 1st\u00a0 Schedule to the\nElectoral Act. It was submitted that the provisions of\u00a0Paragraphs 47 (1) and 53 (5) are mandatory. It was submitted that the provisions of\u00a0 Paragraph 47 (1) and 53 (5)\n8\nof the\u00a0First\u00a0Schedule to the Electoral Act require\nstrict compliance and same cannot be waived by\nreliance on Paragraph 12 (5) where objection\ntouches the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\nThe Court was urged to resolve issue 1 in favour of\nthe Appellant and reverse the decision of the\nTribunal to determine the motion of 16/10/2014\nwith the petition.\nOn issue 2, it was submitted that the approach of\nthe Tribunal in relying on the cases of Continental\nTrust Bank & 5 ORS v. Balogun (2003) FWLR\n(Pt 162) 1908 and The Senate President FRN\nv. Nzeribe (2004) 9 NWLR (Pt 878) 251 does\nnot follow in the nature of election petition which is\nsui generis and in which time is of the essence.\nIt was submitted that cases in which preliminary\nobjections were heard with the substantive suits\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/31\nwere/are usually commenced by originating\nsummons which do not require oral evidence.\nIt was further submitted that where there are\nmandatory provisions like Paragraphs 18 (3) and\n(4), 47 (1) and 53 (5), the Tribunal cannot exercise\nunfettered discretion to hear a preliminary\nobjection touching on jurisdiction together with the\npetition.\nOn issue 3, it was submitted that the Tribunal\ncannot on the ground of interest of justice decline\n9\nto follow the rules of procedure which bind it in an\nelection petition which is sui generis. It was also\nsubmitted that the Tribunal was wrong in holding\nthat it would determine the preliminary objection\nwith the petition since it could not see the\nmiscarriage of justice or injustice that the Appellant\nwould suffer.\nThe Respondents' grounds of objection were that\ngrounds 1 and 3 of the grounds of appeal were of\nmixed law and facts which required leave of the\nTribunal or this Court. Grounds 2, 4, 5 and 6 are in\nrespect of obiter dictum from which there cannot be\nan appeal and that some of the grounds are\nargumentative, repetitive, vague, nebulous and\nverbose.\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n10/31\nArguing the preliminary objection, it was submitted\nthat where no leave is sought as in this\ninterlocutory appeal, such appeal is incompetent\nand should be struck out. We were referred to\nAudu v. I.N.E.C. (No. 1) 2010 13 NWLR (Pt\n1212) 421 and Ndayako v. Mohammed (2005)\n6 NWLR (pt 920) 86 at 92 . It was submitted that\nGrounds 1 and 3 of the Notice of Appeal involve the\nexercise of discretion which is a matter of mixed\nlaw and facts.\nIt is surprising learned counsel for the Respondents\nargued that the Appellants formulated two grounds\nof appeal from the ratio decidendi of the ruling and\nfour grounds from obiter dictum. The law, it was\n10\nsubmitted is that it is not everything said by a\nCourt that can be subject of appeal. The Grounds of\nappeal, it was submitted, must arise from the ratio\ndecidendi of the case. We were referred to Ejeka v\nState (2003) 7 NWLR (pt 819) 408 at 424,\nSaraki v. Kotoye (1992) 9 NWLR (Pt 264) 156\nat 184, Chami v. UBA PLC (2010) 6 NWLR (Pt\n1191) 474 at 502.\nArguing the main appeal, learned counsel for the\nRespondents submitted that the issue for\ndetermination is basically on the interpretation of\nParagraphs 53 (5) and 12 (5) of the 1st Schedule to the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended).\nIt was submitted that Paragraph 53 (5) took effect\nfrom 10/8/2010 whereas the provision of\nParagraph 12 (5) which was a subsequent provision\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n11/31\ncame into effect on 29th October, 2010. It was\nsubmitted that the intention of the Law Makers in\nenacting the provisions of Section 12 (5) was\nintended to achieve quick disposal of election\npetitions within the time frame. We were referred\nto NTO & ANOR v. GLOBAL SOAP &\nDETERGENT IND. LTD . (2012) LPELR 7997.\nMakera & Anor v. Galadachi & Ors (2011)\nLPELR 8821.\nParagraph 53 (5) of the 1st Schedule to the\nElectoral Act is now by implication amended by the\nprovision of Paragraph 12 (5). Reliance was placed\non Akintokun v. LPDC (2014) 5 SCM 1 at 50 .\n11\nIt was submitted that the Tribunal was right to\nhave held that in line with Paragraph 12 (5) of the\n1st Schedule to the Electoral Act, all objections\nshould be taken along with the petition because\nelection petitions are time-bound and a party will\nnot be allowed to resort to any subterfuge to\nfrustrate the intention of the Electoral Act that\npetitions be disposed of expeditiously.\nWe were referred to part of the ruling of the\nTribunal in which it observed that the appellant\nincorporated objections to the competence of the\npetition in his reply. It was submitted that having\nincorporated his objection in his reply, he would not\nrightly argue that the objection ought to be taken\nbefore the hearing of the appeal. We were referred\nto Oke & Ors v. Mimiko & Ors (2013) 9 SCM\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/31\n155 at 177 and PDP v. INEC (2012) 7 NWLR\n(Pt 1130) 538 at 559.\nIt was submitted that Nwankwo v. Yaradua\n(2010) 12 NWLR (Pt 1209) 518 at 589 was\ndecided before Paragraph 12 (5) was enacted.\nIt was submitted that locus standi and jurisdiction\nwere not considered in the ruling of the tribunal.\nThat the issue before the Tribunal was whether the\nobjection raised in the application be heard or await\nthe hearing of the petition.\nIt was submitted that the amendment of Paragraph\n12\n12 was not only to facilitate the speedy trial of\nElection Petitions but also to obviate the attendant\ndelay that is associated with Civil Proceedings. It\nwas submitted that election petitions are to be\nheard without regard to technicalities, which may\nunduly fetter the jurisdiction of the tribunals. We\nwere referred to Egolum v. Obasanjo (1999) 7\nNWLR (Pt 611) 355, Ogbebor v. Danjuma\n(2003) 15 NWLR (pt 803) 403.\nIn a reply to the 1st and 2nd Respondents' brief,\nthe Appellant on his part objected to the\nRespondents' brief on the ground that it was filed\nout of time. The 1st and 2nd Respondents' brief, it was\nsubmitted, was filed eight (8) days after they were\nserved with the Appellant's brief instead of filing\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/31\nsame within five (5) days as provided by Paragraph\n12 of the Election Tribunal and Court Practice\nDirections 2011. We were referred to Action\nCongress of Nigeria v. Rear Admiral Murtala H.\nNyako & Ors SC. 409/2012 delivered on 5th\nNovember, 2012. We were urged to strike out the 1st and 2nd Respondent's brief of argument and determine the appeal on the Appellant's Brief alone.\nAt the hearing of the appeal, Adegoke Esq learned\ncounsel for Appellant withdrew this \"preliminary\nobjection\" to the 1st and 2nd Respondents' brief.\n13\nOn the Respondents' Objection to the hearing of\nthe appeal on the ground that the grounds were of\nmixed law and facts, it was submitted that by\nParagraph 246 (1) (C) (ii) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), there is an express right of appeal against an interlocutory decision of a Gubernatorial election\ntribunal. Reliance was place on Awuse v. Odili (2003) 18 NWLR (pt 851) 116 at 169 and the recent unreported decision of this Court in ALL\nPROGRESSIVES CONGRESS v. Senator Iyiola\nOmisore Appeal No: CA/AK/EPT\n/GOV/203/2014 in which this Court dismissed a\nsimilar objection.\nOn the contention by the Respondents that\nincomplete records were filed by the Appellant, it\nwas submitted that the records filed were in\ncompliance with Paragraph 10 of the Election\nTribunal and Court Practice Directions, 2011. In\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n14/31\nany case, although they have complained of\nincomplete records, the Respondents have\nthemselves not taken the necessary steps of\ncompiling what is missing or critical to the\ndetermination of the appeal.\nIt was submitted that the case of Nwana v. F C D\nA (2007) 11 NWLR (pt 1044) 59 relied upon by\nRespondents is not relevant to this case.\nOn the Respondents' argument that grounds of\nappeal and particulars are incompetent, it was\n14\nsubmitted that the Respondents having found\nthemselves in a difficult situation are appealing to\nmere technicalities to defeat the appeal.\nWhat the Appellant has done, it was submitted, is\nto attack each error upon which the decision of the\nLower Court is based.\nIn the main reply to the 1st and 2nd Respondents'\nbrief, it was submitted that the case of Nto & Anor\nv. Global Soap & Detergent Ind. (2012) LPELR\n7997 is a civil case in which reference was made to\na dissenting opinion in Saror & Anor v. Suswam &\nOrs.\nIt was submitted that an objection to delay in filing\na reply to the petition could never have been\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/31\nincorporated in the Appellants Reply and that the\nRespondents have conceded to this.\nThe essence of the preliminary objection, it was\nsubmitted, was to challenge the locus standi of the\nRespondents to present the petition.\nThe issue of injustice or miscarriage of justice to be\nsuffered by the Appellant, it was again submitted\nwas raised suo motu by the Tribunal.\nThe main grouse of the 1st and 2nd Respondents in\ntheir preliminary objection is that the grounds of\nappeal are of mixed law and fact which require the\nleave of this Court and no such leave has been\n15\nsought or granted. The 1st and 2nd Respondents in\na recent appeal NO: CA/EPT/GOV/203/14 raised a\nsimilar objection. This Court in its judgment\ndelivered by Owoade JCA on 14th November, 2014\noverruled the objection because the objection did\nnot affect the competence of the Appellant's Notice\nof Appeal. This is what the Court at page 8 - 9 of\nthe unreported judgment stated:\n\"For example, Section 246 (1) (b) (ii) of the\n1999 Constitution as amended truly gives a\nleeway to the Appellant to file an appeal on\nany decision (including interlocutory)\ndecisions of a Gubernatorial election tribunal.\nThus, in the case of Awuse v. Odili (2003) 18\nNWLR (pt. 851) 116 at 119, Ejiwunmi JSC\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/31\nsupported the lead judgment of I.L. Kutugi JSC\nquoted the provision of Section 246 (1) (b) (ii) of\nthe 1999 Constitution as amended and said of the\nSection as follows:\n\"An appeal to the Court of Appeal shall lie as\nof right from the decision of the Governorship\nElection Tribunal on any question as to\nwhether any person has been validly elected\nto the office of Governor\".\n\"Though the word \"any\" when used as an\nadjective is defined in Longman Dictionary of\nthe English Language thus:\n\"One or some indiscriminately, whichever is\nchosen\". It would appear that the word \"any\"\n16\nqualifying \"question\" was deliberately used by\nthe law makers to indicate that an appeal to\nthe Court of Appeal was not limited only to\nhearing appeals only to whether any person\nhas been validly elected to the office of\nGovernor... It follows therefore that the\nprovisions of Section 246 (1) allows appeals\nto lie to Court of Appeal in respect of\ninterlocutory decision of the Governorship\nElection Tribunals and the other tribunals\nnamed in that\u00a0Section of the Constitution\" .\nAlso in the case of Maduako V Onyejiocha\n(2009) 5 NWLR (pt. 1134) 259 at 280, the Court\nof Appeal Per Eko JCA held as follows:-\n\"By way of emphasis, I wish to add that the\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/31\ndecision of the Supreme Court in Alhaji Atiku\nAbubakar & Ors V. Alhaji Umaru Musa\nYar'Adua & Ors SC 288/2007 of 25th January,\n2008 (reported in (2008) 4 NWLR (pt. 1078)\n465 Per Niki Tobi JSC, leave no doubt in me\nthat an aggrieved party has right of appeal\nagainst an interlocutory decision of an\nelection tribunal. That right is a constitutional\nright by dint of Section 246 (1) (b) of the\n1999 Constitution, which is in Pari materia\nwith Section 233 (2) (3) of the Constitution\nunder which Atiku V. Yar'Adua case was\ndecided\".\nFrom the above authorities, it becomes clear that\n17\nthe Appellant has a constitutional right to appeal\nwithout leave of\u00a0Court on any interlocutory decision\nof a Governorship Election Tribunal and that put\npaid to the objection by the Respondents that the\nAppellant needed to have sought leave of the\ntribunal or this\u00a0Court on his grounds of appeal on\nquestions of mixed law and facts.\"\nIt is clear from the foregoing that the preliminary\nobjection must be overruled. It is accordingly\noverruled and dismissed.\nThis Court adopts the lone issue formulated by the\n1st and 2nd Respondents as the only issue for\ndetermination.\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/31\nParagraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule to the\nElectoral Act 2010 provides as follows:\n\"5. A respondent who has an objection to the\nhearing of the petition shall file his reply and\nstate the objection therein and the objection\nshall be heard along with the substantive\npetition.\"\nParagraph 53 (5) of the same Schedule to the\nElectoral Act on the other hand provides thus:\n\"(5) An objection challenging the irregularity\nor competence of an election petition shall be\nheard and determined after the close of\npleadings.\"\nIt s now trite law that election petitions are sui\ngeneris that is, that they are in class of their own\nand are governed by different rules. An election\n18\npetition is by nature a very peculiar proceeding\nwhich distinguishes it from an ordinary civil\nproceeding. See Abubakar v. Yar'adua (2008)\n19 NWLR (Pt 1120) 1. In Nwole v. Iwuagwu\n(2004) 15 NWLR (Pt 895) 61 the Court, held\nthus:\n\"The Courts have often harped on the need to\ndo substantial justice in most cases without\ndwelling too much on technicalities ... in all\nelection matters, the use of technicalities\nshould be avoided, as technicalities merely\nhelp to shut the opponent out. It never\nresolves basic issues in controversy. Once it is\nagreed that election petitions are in a class of\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/31\ntheir own, the handling of the matter too must\ntake a form devoid of legal technicalities that\ntend to leave the litigants more confused.\nBoldness of a high degree is required of the\nelectoral tribunal, which must never be seen\nto shy away from obvious grave allegations.\"\nWhen Paragraph 53 (5) was in being Paragraph 12 (5) came in on the 29th October, 2010 like a\nTrojan Horse. Paragraph 53 (5) itself came into\neffect on 20th August, 2010. Paragraph 12 (5) was\nundoubtedly enacted for a purpose. That purpose\nwas to enable election petition tribunals to handle\nelection petitions without undue reliance on\ntechnicalities. Although Paragraph 53 (5) was not\nrepealed, the law is that the provisions of the later\nenactment amend the earlier so far as necessary to\nremove the inconsistency between them. See\nAkintokun v LPDC (2014) 5 SCM 1, Ogbunaya\n19\nv. Akudo (1979) 6-9 SC 32 and\u00a0DPP v INEC (1999) 11 NWLR (pt 626) 200.\nParagraph 53 (5) is now impliedly repealed by\nParagraph 12 (5). By Paragraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule to the Electoral Act, an objection to the hearing of a petition is authorized to be raised in the\nRespondents reply to the petition.\nLearned counsel for the Appellant thinks the\nposition is rather fluid when the challenge to the\ncompetence or regularity of the election petition is\nnot contained in the reply but is brought by way of\nmotion on notice. I see no difficulty here. If it is a\nchallenge to the tribunal hearing, the petition\nwhether the objection is stated in the reply or is\nbrought by motion on notice, the tribunal has\njurisdiction to hear it along with the substantive\npetition. Paragraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule to the Electoral Act is intended to reflect the sui\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/31\ngeneris nature of election petitions. The mischief it\nintends to cure is to ensure that objections raised\ndo not derail the determination of the merit of a\ncase by undue and unwarranted delay occasioned\nby the preliminary objection. See Oke & ors v.\nMimiko & ors (2013) 9 SCM 155 and PDP v.\nINEC (2012) 7 NWLR (Pt 1130) 538.\nI am of the view that although the Appellant filed\ntwo motions on notice apart from the objections\nincorporated in his reply, \u00a0the Tribunal rightly\ninvoked the provision of Paragraph 12 (5) of the\nFirst Schedule to the Electoral Act 2010 when it\ndecided to take the preliminary objections along\n20\nwith the substantive petition.\nI therefore resolve the issue in favour of the\nRespondents and against the Appellant.\nHaving resolved the issue against the Appellant,\nthis appeal should be dismissed.\nIt is accordingly hereby dismissed by me.\n1st and 2nd Respondents are awarded N30,000\ncosts to be paid by the Appellant.\nMOJEED ADEKUNLE OWOADE, J.C.A.: This is yet\nanother interlocutory appeal on the decision of the\nGovernorship Election Tribunal holden at Osogbo.\nThis appeal is against the interlocutory decision of\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n21/31\nthe said Tribunal (Coram. Justices E.N. Kpojime,\nV.I. Ofebi and A. Kutugi) delivered on Tuesday the\n4th day of November, 2014.\nThe Appellant as 1st Respondent brought two\napplications before the Tribunal. The first, a Notice\nof Preliminary Objection dated 16/10/2014 and\nbrought pursuant to Paragraph 4 (1) of the\u00a0First\nSchedule to the Electoral Act 2010 challenged the\nTribunal's competence to hear the petition as the\n1st and 2nd Respondents lacked the locus standi to\npresent the petition having failed to indicate in the\npetition that they had the right to present the\npetition as required by Paragraph 4 (1) and (2) of\nthe First Schedule to the Electoral Act 2010 (as\n21\namended).\nThe second, dated 21st day of October, 2014 is a\nMotion on Notice praying:\n(a) An order of the Tribunal striking out the\nPetitioner's Reply to the 1st Respondent's\nReply same having been filed out of time\nprescribed, by Paragraph 16 (1) of the\u00a0First\nSchedule to the Electoral Act, 2010 (as\namended); and\n(b) An order of the Tribunal dismissing the\npetition, the petitioners having failed to apply\nfor issuance of Notice of pre-hearing session\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/31\nwithin time as prescribed by Paragraph 18 (1)\nof the First Schedule to the Electoral Act, 2010\n(as amended).\nOn the 30th day of October, 2014, the Tribunal\ncommenced pre-hearing sessions and the two\napplications came up for hearing when Counsel to\nthe 1st and 2nd Respondents (petitioners) orally\napplied that the Appellants preliminary objections\nbe heard together with the petition. This application\nwas opposed by the Appellant and the 3rd\nRespondent in this appeal.\nHowever, the Tribunal granted the prayer of the 1st\nand 2nd Respondents in its Ruling of 4th\nNovember, 2014 wherein their lordships of the\nTribunal ruled that the said applications shall be\nheard with the petition and ruling shall be delivered\n22\nat the end of trial.\nThe position of the Appellant in this appeal as are\nsummarized in the concluding paragraphs of the\nAppellant's Brief of Argument are as follows:\n1. A challenge against locus standi to present\na petition is a jurisdictional issue which when\nmade by motion on notice ought to be\ndetermined at the pre-hearing session in\naccordance with Paragraph 47 (1) of the\u00a0First\nSchedule to the Electoral Act, 2010 (as\namended).\n2. Paragraph 12 (5) of the\u00a0First\u00a0Schedule to the\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/31\nElectoral Act, 2010 only addresses where\npreliminary objections are embedded in a\nReply to a petition and not where same is\nraised by Motion on Notice by which\nParagraph 47 (1) becomes immediately\noperative.\n3. It is not the intention of the legislature to\nuse to IMPLIEDLY abrogate\nParagraph 18 (3) and (4), 47 (1) and 53 (5) of\nthe\u00a0First\u00a0Schedule to the Electoral Act, 2010\n(as amended).\n4. The only means of challenging the\njurisdiction of the Tribunal to entertain an\nabandoned petition where the petitioners\nfailed to file an application for pre-hearing\nsession within time stipulated by the Rules is\nby Motion on Notice which ought to be heard\nand determined at the pre-hearing session and\n23\ncannot be deferred.\n5. The decision of the Tribunal to leave the\npreliminary objections of the Appellant till the\nconclusion of hearing of the petition is an\nunmitigated assault on Paragraphs 18 (3) and\n(4) of the\u00a0First\u00a0Schedule to the Electoral Act,\n2010, by which the Tribunal, at the instance of\nthe Appellant, is mandated to dismiss the\npetition in limine.\n6. The failure of the Tribunal to hear and\ndetermine the Appellant's preliminary\nobjection at the pre-hearing session\nconstitutes violence on the sacred provisions\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/31\nof Paragraphs 47 (1) of the\u00a0First\u00a0Schedule to\nthe Electoral Act, 2010 by which the Tribunal\nought to hear and determine all motions at the\npre-hearing session.\n7. The decision of the Tribunal to hear and\ndetermine the preliminary objections of the\nAppellant during pre-hearing session is an\nassault on Paragraph 53 (5) of the\u00a0First\nSchedule to the Electoral Act, 2010 which\nmandates the Tribunal to hear and determine\npreliminary objections touching on the\ncompetence of a petition at the close of\npleadings.\n8. Reliance on inapplicable authorities in civil\ncases to justify hearing preliminary objection\ntogether with the substantive petition does\nnot take cognizance of the sui generis nature\nof election petitions and the fact that\nParagraphs 18 (3) and (4), 47 (1) and 53 (5)\n24\nare legislative devices to enforce the\nparamouncy of time threshold in election\npetitions.\n9. No judge has the right to appeal to\nsentiments of substantive justice, lack of\nprejudice to be suffered or miscarriage of\njustice where statutes have prescribed time\nlimitation for doing an act.\n10. The Tribunal has no further jurisdiction to\nentertain the petition same having been\nabandoned by the parties as \"there is nothing\nas useless as doing efficiently what should not\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/31\nhave been done in the first place\" . Per Rhodes -\nVivour, JSC in Dr. Opara & Anor v. Hon. Amadi\n& anor (2013) 6 - 7 SC (pt. II) 49 at 68.\nLearned Senior Counsel, for the Respondents\nrecognized that the lone issue for determination in\nthis appeal is whether the lower tribunal was right\nwhen it held that Appellant's applications dated\n16th October, 2014 and 21st October, 2014 will be\ntaken along with the petition.\nHe submitted that the issue that is germane in this\nappeal is basically on the interpretation of\nParagraph 53 (5) and Paragraph 12 (5) of the First Schedule to Electoral Act, 2010 as amended. He stated that among other enabling\nprovisions took effect from 20th August, 2010\nwhereas provision of Paragraph 12 (5) which was a\nsubsequent provision came into effect on 29th\nOctober, 2010. This, he said presupposes that\n25\nParagraph 12 (5) is a new innovation in the\nElectoral Act, 2010 (as amended).\nHe referred to the cases of NTO & ANOR V Global\nSoap & Detergent Ind. Ltd (2012) LPELR -\n7997; Makera & Anor v.\u00a0Galadanchi\u00a0&\u00a0Ors\n(2011) LPELR - 8821; Akintokun V LPDC\n(2014) 5 SCM 1 at 50 and concluded that based\non the provision of Paragraph 12 (5) of the\u00a0First\nSchedule, the Tribunal was right to have held that\nthe Appellant's applications will be taken along with\n5/8/25, 11:02 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/31\nthe petition.\nI do agree with the Learned Senior Counsel for the\nRespondents that the provisions of Paragraph 12\n(5) of the\u00a0First\u00a0Schedule are inconsistent with the\nearlier provision of Paragraph 53 (5) but by\nimplication amends the earlier so far as is\nnecessary to remove the inconsistency between\nthem. Indeed, Paragraph 12 (5) stipulates that a\nRespondent who has an objection to the hearing of\nthe petition shall file his reply and state the\nobjection, which will be determined with the\nsubstantive petition.

Whoever abets\nany offence shall, if the act abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment and no express provision is made by this Penal Code or by any other law\nfor the time being in force for the punishment of such abetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence.\" It is obvious that the Section\nrequires that, apart from the abetment, the act abetted should have been actually committed. The Section requires the proof not only of the acts or\nomissions constituting the abetment but also of the commission of the act abetted in consequence of the abetment.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - ELEMENTS OF AN OFFENCE - Statutory provision which provides for cases where the initial element of an\noffence occured outside a State\n\"Section 4(2) (b) of the Penal Code Law which deals with cases in which the \"initial element\" occurs outside the State, does require that the person who\ndoes that act or omission should \"afterwards enter\" the State before being triable or punishable under the Penal Code.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - \"ENTER\" - Interpretation the word \"enter\" as used in Section 4(2)(b) of the Penal Code\n\"The learned Director of Public Prosecutions submitted on this aspect of the case that any mode of entry is sufficient for the purpose of the Section and\nthat even if the accused persons were kidnapped and brought into the State they have indeed entered the State within the meaning and intent of the\nprovisions of Section (4)(2)(b) of the Penal Code. We are satisfied ourselves that to construe the word \"enter\" in the subsection as meaning only a voluntary\nentry would be completely ridiculous since in that circumstance no criminal will ever enter the State when he knows or realises that such entry may make\nhim triable by the laws of the State.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - SECTION 4(2) OF THE PENAL CODE LAW - Interpretation of Section 4(2) of the Penal Code Law as regards an\noffence with several elements and the appropriate State to try such offender\n\"Admittedly Section 4 (2) of the Penal Code Law is not easy to construe. The Section is concerned with an offence that comprises several elements and\nidentifies these elements with \"acts, omissions or events\". It is clear therefore that the \"element\" in the Section is more widely conceived and is not and\nshould not be limited to either an actus reus or the mens rea in conventional criminal jurisprudence.The \"initial element\" to which reference is made in the\nSection is the initial act or omission concerned and for the purpose of applying Section 4 (2) it is necessary to look for that \"initial element\". If (a) that \"initial\nact or omission\" occurs in the State even though the other \"elements\" do not, the person who does that \"initial act or omission\" is punishable by the State\nunder the Penal Code; on the other hand, if (b) that \"initial act or omission\" occurs outside the State, the other or others occurring within the State and the\nperson who does that \"initial act or omission\" afterwards enters the State, he is by such entry triable by the State under the Penal Code.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - OFFENCE OF ABETMENT - The initial element of the offence of abetment\n\"In a charge of abetment of an offence the \"initial element\" is the instigation or positive act of encouragement to do the act or omission which constitutes\nthe offence.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - OFFENCE OF CONSPIRACY - Nature of the offence of conspiracy\n\"The overt act or omission which evidences conspiracy is the actus reus and the actus reus of each and every conspirator must be referrable and very\noften is the only proof of the criminal agreement which is called conspiracy. It is not necessary to prove that the conspirators, like those who murdered\nJulius Ceasar, were seen together coming out of the same place at the same time and indeed conspirators need not know each other. See R. v. Meyrick and\nRibuffi (1929) 21 C. App. R. 94. They need not all have started the conspiracy at the same time for a conspiracy started by some persons may be joined at a\nlater stage or later stages by others. The gist of the offence of conspiracy is the meeting of the mind of the conspirators. This is hardly capable of direct\nproof for the offence of conspiracy is complete by the agreement to do the act or make the omission complained about. Hence, conspiracy is a matter of\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/66\ninference from certain criminal acts of the parties concerned done in pursuance of an apparent criminal purpose in common between them and in proof of\nconspiracy the acts or omissions of any of the conspirators in furtherance of the common design may be and very often are given in evidence against any\nother or others of the conspirators. It is, therefore, the duty of the Court in every case of conspiracy to ascertain as best as it could the evidence of the\ncomplicity of any of those charged with that offence.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - DEFENCE/PLEA OF ALIBI - Meaning and nature of the defence of alibi\n\"There is nothing extraordinary or esoteric in a plea of alibi. Such a plea postulates that the accused person could not have been at the scene of the crime\nand only inferentially that he was not there. Even if it is the duty of the prosecution to check on a statement of alibi by an accused person and disprove the\nalibi or attempt to do so, there is no inflexible and/or invariable way of doing this. If the prosecution adduce sufficient and accepted evidence to fix the\nperson at the scene of crime at the material time, surely his alibi is thereby logically and physically demolished. The Supreme Court had had the occasion\nto consider this point in Hemyo Atam and Anor v. The State, SC. 632/66 decided on the 11th January, 1967 and had observed on this point as follows: \"Each\nof the appellants made a statement under caution after his arrest, setting up an alibi. The police officer who took the statements was asked whether he had\ndone anything to check their truth and said that he had not and it was submitted that for this reason justice had been denied to the appellants and there\nshould at least have been a reasonable doubt as to their guilt. There are occasions on which a failure to check an alibi may cast doubt on the reliability of\nthe case for the prosecution, but in a case such as this where the appellants were identified by three eyewitnesses there was a straight issue of credibility\nand we are not able to say that the judge's findings of fact were unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. If the alibis had been\ntrue it would have been open to the appellants to call witnesses in support of them and neither of them did so.\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - OFFENCE OF RECEIVING STOLEN GOODS/PROPERTY - Essential ingredients of the offence of receiving stolen\nproperty\n\"By the provisions of Section 317 and in order to sustain a charge under that section, the prosecution must prove that the receiver knows that the property\nhe was receiving was \"stolen property...\"\nCRIMINAL LAW AND PROCEDURE - OFFENCE OF CONSPIRACY - Forms of conspiracy\n\"All the accused persons are charged with various counts of specific offences comprising of acts or omissions which would constitute for each of them the\nactus reus to associate him with the conspiracy for be it known conspiracies take various forms and whilst a conspiracy may exist in the form of one\nconspirator being like the hub of a bicycle the others rotating around him, another conspiracy may be in the form of a chain in which one conspirator hooks\non to the other and so on ad infinitum, or indeed a conspiracy may exist in both of those forms or in other forms.\"\nJUDGEMENT SUMMARY\nINTRODUCTION:\nThis appeal borders on Criminal Law and Procedure.\nFACTS:\nThis appeal emanated from the High Court, Ilorin in the Kwara State on a 9 count charge. An appeal was brought to the Supreme Court in relation to robbery by Felix\nDumeh and the act of abetment by Patrick Njovens, Y.L. Bellow, Alhaji Amusa Abidogun and Chief Samuel Taiwo Oredein who sometime in April, 1971 at Ibadan had\nprevious knowledge of the robbery. The act of abetment was carried out by intentionally aiding, encouraging and instigating the commission of the said offence by\nagreeing with Felix Dumeh and others and promising on oath to conceal the said offence when committed and by taking no action to prevent its commission. The\ngrounds of appeal that were filed amongst others are that the High Court, Ilorin should not have exercised its jurisdiction to try the accused persons on the offences\ncharged since they were not offences contemplated by the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria which is applicable in Kwara State.\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n4/66\nISSUES:\nThe Court determined the appeal based on the issues joined by the parties.\nDECISION/HELD:\nIn the final analysis, the Supreme Court directed that all the accused persons be discharged and acquitted on the counts other than count 1 and count 2 on which they\nwere severally convicted by the learned trial judge. The appeal of the accused persons in respect of count 1 and count 2, was dismissed and their convictions and\nsentences affirmed.\nGEORGE\u00a0BAPTIST\u00a0AYODOLA\u00a0COKER, J.S.C.:\n(Delivering the Leading\u00a0Judgment):\nThe four appellants were respectively\nthe 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th accused persons tried\ntogether by Adesiyun, J. in the High Court,\u00a0Ilorin in\nthe Kwara State.

Seventeen witnesses gave evidence for the\nprosecution and one of them, Felix Dumeh (17th\nP.W.), was a self-confessed robber who made a\nclean breast of the whole show and told the whole\nstory of the robbery concerned as well as other\nrobberies in which he had been involved. The\nevidence of these witnesses seriously implicated\nthe four appellants (hereinafter in this judgment to\nbe referred to as accused persons in the order in\nwhich they were so signified in the High Court) and\ntold in a rather vivid way the several parts played\n9\nby the several accused persons in the whole\nexercise. Among the witnesses were as well a\nnumber of policemen who were completely\nblameless and whose courage in the face of obvious\ndanger needs more than a passing remark.\nBetween these two categories, there are some\nwitnesses who at one time or another had been\ninvolved in different crimes and who acknowledged\nvarious degrees of inglorious criminal records.\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n11/66\n?Each of the accused persons soon after his arrest\nmade statements to the police and it is convenient\nto set the position with respect to the various\nstatements of the accused persons as follows:\n1st Accused:\n(i) Exhibit 18, made on the 1st June, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n(ii) Exhibit 27, made on the 10th June, 1971 to\nP.W. 15 at Ibadan.\n(iii) Exhibit 17, made on the 6th July, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n2nd Accused:\n(i) Exhibit 15, made on the 31st May, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n(ii) Exhibit 16, made on the 1st June, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n(iii) Exhibit 32 made on the 10th June, 1971 to\nP.W. 15 at Ilorin.\n(iv) Exhibit 33 made on the 10th June, 1971 to\nP.W. 15 at Ilorin.\n(v) Exhibit 14 made on the 6th July, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n10\n3rd Accused:\n(i) Exhibit 28, made on the 31 st May, 1971 to P.\nW. 16 at Ilorin.\n(ii) Exhibit 29, made on the 10th June, 1971 to\nP.W. 15 at Ilorin.\n(iii) Exhibit 46, unsigned and undated, made on the\n5th July, 1971 to P.W. 8 at Ilorin.\n(iv) Exhibit 7 made on the 5th July, 1971 to P.W. 8\nat Ilorin.\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/66\n4th Accused:\n(i) Exhibit 8, made on the 30th May, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n(ii) Exhibit 9, made on the 3rd June, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n(iii) Exhibit 10 made on the 6th June, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n(iv) Exhibit 11 made on the 6th June, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n(v) Exhibit 12 made on the 6th June, 1971 to P.W.\n8 at Ilorin.\n(vi) Exhibit 13, made on the 22nd June, 1971 to\nP.W. 8 at Ilorin.\n?At their trial, all the accused persons gave\nevidence in their defence. Whilst the third accused\nperson called no witnesses, the first accused called\nfour witnesses, the second accused called one\nwitness and the fourth accused person called six\nwitnesses. Each of the accused persons denied the\nallegations against him and in particular the 2nd\n11\nand the 4th accused persons set up the plea of\nalibi, the 4th accused stating that at the material\ntime with which the 2nd count is concerned he was\nin his hometown Ogere in the Western State and\nthe 2nd accused stating that he was at the material\ntime with which the 2nd count is concerned at the\nPolice Station in Ibadan.\n?\nThe evidence of the prosecution witnesses is of\nthe same pattern, that is to say, it is to the effect\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/66\nthat the accused persons well knew of the plan to\ncommit the robbery later committed along the\nBacita Road in Ilorin, Kwara State on the 13th day\nof April, 1971 before the date, that those of them\nthat could prevent its commission refused, failed or\nneglected to do so tendentiously and that all the\naccused persons encouraged the commission of the\nrobbery by the 17th P.W., Felix Dumeh, an\narch-robber, and his gang, that later that night the\nparties, including all the accused persons, took an\noath of secrecy in the house of Felix Dumeh to\nensure the continued protection of the robbers from\ndetection, and that thereafter the accused persons\ncollected from Felix Dumeh, as their own share of\nthe loot, an amount of 5,000 which was part of the\nmoney stolen in the cause of the robbery.\n?A witness for the prosecution, Mustapha Adigun,\nalias Balewa (1st P.W.) testified that he knew all\nthe accused persons, the first three being police\nofficers and the 4th one being a politician and his\nown boss during the days of politics when he, i.e.\nthe witness, used to be the head of the thugs of the\n4th accused. In the course of his evidence, he\n12\ndescribed the event in the house of Felix Dumeh on\nthe night of the robbery as follows:\n\"We went to the house of Felix.

It was then I saw that it contained money.\nAccused one asked 'how much?' Felix replied five,\naccused one asked, is that the arrangement?, Felix\nanswered 'The boys are too many on it'. Accused\none said before the arrangement was seven'. The\nmoney that I saw was in bundles of 1pound and 10s\n13\ncurrency notes.\"\n?The witness was severely cross-examined by\ncounsel for the accused persons and indeed\nconfronted with the statement which he made to\nthe police in Lagos and which was admitted in\nevidence at the trial as exhibit 1. The witness\nhowever persisted in his evidence and denied all\nsuggestions of discrepancies. It was suggested to\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/66\nhim for instance, in cross-examination, that he had\nbeen whipped by the police into making the\nstatement exhibit 1 but he denied the suggestion.\n?\nAn application was then made to the learned trial\njudge for the witness to exhibit his bare back to the\nCourt so application was refused by the learned trial\njudge even after that issue had been separately\ntried on the evidence on witness including the 4th\naccused. The story of the robbery was confirmed by\nthe 4th P. W., Alimi Adebayo Ajisafe, an official of\nthe Barclays Bank at Ilorin, Mudashiru Ajani\nLayiwola, the 2nd P. W. and a motor-driver, was\nanother witness of admittedly criminal character.\nHe testified, inter alia, that on the 6th April, 1971,\nwhen he was arrested by the 1st and 2nd accused\npersons in front of the Easy Life Hotel at Mokola in\nIbadan, he told both the 1st and the 2nd accused\npersons, who had requested of him some\ninformation about Felix Dumeh and Lieutenant\nUsman (another arch-robber), that Felix Dumeh\nwas planning another robbery to take place in the\nKwara State during that same month and indeed\ntold them that the robbery was to take place on\neither the 13th or the 27th April. He was\n14\nmanifestly a person of ignominious character for in\nthe course of his cross-examination he stated:\n\"The police in Ibadan punished me and I also feel\nthat they made me to make incriminating\nstatements about the theft of the car. These two\nevents made me unhappy. After I had done good\nthing for the police, their conduct displease me.\nMy last jail sentence was for 10 years but I won on\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/66\nappeal early this year. I was sentenced for\nmanslaughter in relation to the death of a prison\nwarder at Ilesha. It was in relation with\nCo-operative Bank robbery of 19,000 pounds at\nAkure which i led.\"\n?Later, and still under cross-examination, the\nwitness said this of himself:\n\"I was first convicted for murder of the warder, but\nit was reduced to manslaughter by the\u00a0Appeal\u00a0Court\nand I was sentenced to 10 years. I am now 31\nyears of age. I was first sentenced in Lagos to 5\nyears for stealing. I have not been taken to\u00a0Court\nfor the theft of the car which I sold to Usman. I\ndon't know anything about the gun battle with the\ncar along Jericho that is between accused two and\nUsman.\n?I am a truthful witness in this case. I opened the\nway for the police. . .\nI was prosecuted for the Co-operative Bank robbery\nand discharged.\nThe robbery took place in September 8, 1966. All\nwhat I said yesterday was true.\"\nSo the witness maintained that with respect to the Kwara robbery, he was speaking the truth. He told the Court that he took both the 1st and the 2nd accused to the\nhouse of Felix Dumeh, showed them the four men whom Felix Dumeh had brought from Lagos to Ibadan to do the Kwara job and after arresting these men the 1st and\n2nd accused persons released them on bail again to Felix Dumeh. He testified that the 1st and 2nd accused persons? asked him to show them where they could get\n15\nhold of one Chukwumeka Onyemechi (alias Chuks)\nand that he took the police to the house of the girl\nfriend of Chuks where he was arrested. The story of\nhis arrest by the 1st and 2nd accused persons was\nconfirmed by Chuks himself (3rd P.W.) who also\ntold the\u00a0Court of how Felix Dumeh, after having\nrevealed to him the plan for the Kwara robbery of\n13th April, 1971 unsuccessfully tried to persuade\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/66\nhim (witness) to join in the operation. The witness\nfurther stated that indeed on the 10th April, 1971\nhe was arrested by the 1st and 2nd accused\npersons for an offence which he did not commit and\nthat when Felix Dumeh visited the 1st and 2nd\naccused persons at the Ibadan police station he,\nFelix Dumeh, refused the appeal of the witness to\nhim to stand bail for him. He further testified as\nfollows:\n\"When Felix left, accused one asked me why Felix\ndid not want to bail me. I told him that it was\nbecause I did not want to take part in the robbery\nat Kwara State. I added that I had taken part in the\noperation before but because I did not co-operate\nthe operation was not carried out.\nAccused one asked accused two if he believed what\nI said about Felix whom he had known for eight\nyears. I then told accused one that if he would not\nbelieve me, he should mount a road block on\n13-4-71 or 27-4-71. Accused two was at that time\nsitting with accused one. The road block should be\nmounted along U.I. on Ibadan to Ilorin road.\"\n?Furthermore, the witness stated that on the night\nof the 12th April, 1971 he was locked up in the cell\n16\nat the Ibadan police station by the 1st and 2nd\naccused persons and was only released from the\ncell by the Kwara police on the 20th May, 1971 on\nthe instructions of the Deputy Superintendent of\nPolice, Aremu, of the Kwara State Command.\nContinuing his evidence the witness testified as\nfollows:\n\"When Aremu was leaving the office, he asked me\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/66\nto discuss with accused 2. Accused 2 then told me\nnot to tell anyone what I knew. When Aremu\nre-entered, I was brought to Ilorin. I told the Kwara\npolice all that I knew about the matter.\"\nHe was positive, as stated by him under cross-\nexamination, that the plan for the robbery was in\nhand since January 1971 and that it should have\ntaken place on the 2nd March, 1971. The story of\nthe attempted robbery of the 2nd March, 1971 was\nconfirmed by the 6th P.W. Lasisi Sheidu who\nadmitted having taken part in the robbery of the\nPeugeot car on the night of the\u00a030th\u00a0March,1971\nand narrated how on the 10th of April, during\nhis visit to the house of Felix Dumeh\nhe had met his 1st accused there.\nThe 6th P. W. also described in full the robbery of\nthe 13th April, 1971 on the Bacita Road, the\nopening of the iron box containing the sum of 13\n,000 pounds and as well the sharing out of the loot\nwhich he described as follows:\n\"On our way, Felix started to share the money and\nhe gave me 2 bundles of\u00a0500 each. I\ncomplained that 1,000\u00a0was not enough as\nmy share out of 13,000. He gave Rafiu\n2,000 and Lt. Usman ?2,000and he\n17\ntook 2,000 himself. In fulfilment of his\nprimise to Blankson, he allotted 1,000 to\nBlankson. Both Felix and Usman checked the\nbalance. It was 5,000 made up of 1 pounds\nand 10s currency notes. I saw Felix when he put\nthe 5,000 pounds his own 2,000\u00a0and\nBlankson's 1,000 inside his handbag.\"\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/66\n?This witness,i.e the 6th P. W., admitted that he was\ncharged to\u00a0Court for the Bacita robbery and that the\ncase was still pending. Going back to the evidence\nof the 3rd P.W., that is Chukwuemeka Onyemechi\n(alias Chuks) he testified thus concerning the 4th\naccused.\n\"Accused four visited Felix in February 1971. I do\nnot know that the accused's Mercedes Benz car was\nunder repairs between January and March. The\nfourth accused might have come to Felix in\nFebruary in another Mercedes car because I saw\nhim in a Mercedes car. The car was parked on the\nmain road and he walked to Felix's house. I saw\nsomeone in the car but I could not\u00a0recognize that\nperson because the car was far from me. When he\nleft Felix's house, he walked to the car. By\ndescription, the car was parked about 50 yards to\nthe house of Felix. I saw the accused. I was ironing\nwhen he came.\"\n?Again, the evidence of this witness as to the arrest\nof the four men brought down to Ibadan from Lagos\nby Felix Dumeh and their release on bail to him\nwas confirmed by the 5th P. W., police constable\nLamide Lajide, and this witness confirmed as well\nthat in his presence P.C. Kadiri, on the instructions\n18\nof the 1st accused, slapped the 1st P.W. many\ntimes on his face.\n?As stated before, a number of police officers gave\nevidence at the trial of the accused persons. One of\nthe police officers was Sunday Adebayo Adewusi,\nCommissioner of Police, Kwara State. Testifying\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/66\nconcerning the arrest of Felix Dumeh, the witness\nAdewusi (7th P. W.) said as follows:\n\"I know a man called Felix Dumeh. He was arrested\nby the police under my command in connection\nwith the robbery along Ilorin-Bacita road on\n13-4-71. As a result of our investigation we were\nable to establish that Felix Dumeh and Lt. Usman\ntook part in the highway robbery along Borin-\nBacita road on 13-4-71.\"\nThe witness gave evidence concerning all the\naccused person and told the\u00a0Court how in the\ncourse of his investigation of the case each of the\nfour accused persons was shown the confessional\nstatement of Felix Dumeh and later confronted one\nby one with Felix Dumeh who in their presence and\nto their hearing stated that each and every one of\nthem took part in two ceremonies of oath-taking,\none before and the other after the robbery of the\n13th April, 1971. He stated that the 1st, 2nd and\n3rd accused persons had first tried to deny the\nallegations of Felix Dumah but later started to beg\nhim to assist them. Concerning the 4th accused he\ntestified as follows:\n\"On 26-5-71, I interviewed accused four with Felix\nDumeh. In the presence of accused four, Felix\nDumeh repeated the same allegation he had made\n19\nagainst accused 1, 2 & 3. In the presence of\naccused four Felix said accused four was present in\nhis house on the two occasions of oathtaking along\nwith accused 1, 2 and 3 and that it was accused\nfour who first received the money from him before\naccused three snatched it from accused four.\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n21/66\nAccused four said he did not know Felix Dumeh.\"\nLater, and still in the course of his evidence, the\nwitness Adewusi stated:\n\"Towards the end of June, P. W. 1 was brought to\nme. When he said he knew accused four, I asked\naccused 4 to be brought. Accused four said he knew\nP. W. 1 very well and that P. W. 1 had served\nunder him for about 9 years. He added that P. W. 1\nwas an honest man and during the political days, if\nP.W. 1 was given thousands of pounds, he would\naccount for every penny. P. W. 1 stated in the\npresence of accused four how accused four with\nothers came to the house of Dumeh and state how\nDumeh handed money to accused four and how the\nmoney was snatched from accused four. Accused\nfour admitted that all that P. W. 1 said was correct.\nThere was an argument about the denomination of\nthe money. P.W. 1 said it was of 1 pounds and 10s\ncurrency notes. Accused four nodded his head in\napproval.\"\n?The witness further described the unco-operative\nattitude of the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd accused\npersons to the Kwara State police by their failing or\nrefusing to release Lieutenant Usman to the Police\nat Ilorin, by arresting and locking up on\ntrumped-up charges the policeman whom he had\n20\nsent to Ibadan to investigate the robbery, and by\nthrowing out his policemen from the police station\nat Ibadan and putting up false charges which were\nnever in fact recorded in any authorised books by\nthe accused persons. In the course of his cross-\nexamination, he told the\u00a0Court how the accused\npersons came to Ilorin as follows\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/66\nAccused 4 was brought to Ilorin on 26th May,\n1971.\"\nThe witness described as well the discovery of the\nPeugeot Car No. WQ 1432 which was used in the\nrobbery of the 13th April 1971. This took place at\nOke-Ado in Ibadan in the afternoon of the same\nday of the robbery. The witness stated that he\nfound a number of burglarious exhibits inside the\nPeugeot car and there was evidence of the car\nhaving been involved in a road accident in which it\ncollided with another vehicle described by P.C.\nYakubu Anakali, the 10th P.W., as a state carriage\nmini-bus. The 10th P. W. also confirmed the story\nof the discovery of the stolen Peugeot car.\nThe\u00a0Provincial Police Officer, Ilorin, Mohammed Jimoh\nAremu, the 8th P. W., also gave evidence and\nproduced statements made to him by the accused\npersons. Concerning the entry of the 4th accused in\nIlorin he testified as follows:\n\"Accused four was not arrested in Ibadan on\n26-5-71. He was invited to Ilorin on that day and\nhe came to Ilorin in car WR 6666- Mercedes. I did\nnot accompany accused four to Ilorin after I had\nbeen at the Central C. I. D., Ibadan. I did not\n21\nreturn to Ilorin in his car. I did not enter his car. A\nPolice Inspector was detailed to invite accused four\nto Ilorin. I deny the suggestion that accused four\nwas in communicado from 26-5-71 to 6-6-71.\nAccused four was never detained at the office of\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/66\nComm. of Police. I deny the suggestion that\naccused four was in handcuffs from 27-5-71 to\n6-6-71. I did not chain the accused.\"\n?The witness testified further that the accused\npersons were arrested with warrants at\u00a0Ilorin and\ntold the\u00a0Court in detail the steps taken by him and\nother Police officers from Ilorin to track down the\nrobbers and their associates. Concerning the 3rd\naccused who had himself offered to help him in the\ncourse of his investigation, he testified as follows:\n\"On the following day when accused three came to\nIyaganku Police Station, I gave him the paper\naddressed to him by Adeniji. Accused told me that\nhe was busy that day but said that he would give\nme an informant. He gave me the informant with\nwhom I worked for 2 or 3 days without success.\"\n?Further on his evidence he stated that he left some\nmembers of his investigation team in Ibadan with\ninstruction to arrest Felix Dumeh but that:\n\"As I was obtaining statement on 6th or 7th May\nfrom the suspect at Bacita there was a telephone\ncall from Inspector Sinibi at Ibadan who told me\nthat the members of my team which I left behind at\nIbadan had been arrested for demanding and\nreceiving 10 pounds. I was shocked and I reported\nthe matter to the C. P. I requested that I should go\n22\nto Ibadan. About three days after the telephone\ncall, I went to Ibadan . . . I then asked accused one,\nthe position of the detained policemen. Accused one\ntold me that I could go with them, but they must\nleave the Western State because they were\ncorrupt. I asked for bail bond for me to sign. He\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/66\nsaid they were policemen and whenever they were\nrequired he would send to their Commanding\nOfficer. I then told accused one that these\nconstables were detailed by the C.P. Kwara to carry\nout certain investigations and that I could not take\nthem out of the Western State.\"\nTestifying further, the witness stated:\n\"As a result of what P. C. Hawak (one of the\nconstables detained) told me, I returned to accused\none that I was looking for Lt. Usman. Accused one\ntold me that Lt. Usman was in cell in connection\nwith robbery. When I told accused one that Lt.\nUsman was wanted in Ilorin in connection with a\nrobbery, he said that he could not release Usman to\nme . . ......................\n?Three days later when I called on accused one, he\nmarched me before A.C.P. Odofin and stated that I\nwas causing trouble between C.L.D. Ibadan and\nKwara Police. I explained myself and later left for\nBenin. I returned to Ibadan on the following day\nand I learnt that Usman was still in Ibadan. On the\nfollowing day I saw Usman being taken to\u00a0Court in\nIbadan. He was later returned to the cell at\nIyaganku Police Station. Following the information\nreceived, my men surrounded the place where\nUsman was with automatic weapons and gave them\n23\ninstruction to shoot if there was any move to whisk\nUsman out.\"\n?Concerning the Peugeot car which had been kept\nwith the C.I.D. Ibadan during the investigation of\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/66\nthe robbery and the search for the robbers, the 8th\nP. W. further in his evidence stated;\n\"I went to Akure and Benin. When I later returned\nto Ibadan, I went to the M.T.D. to look for that\nPeugeot. It was no more there. I found it at the\nS.C.O.A. Motor Garage at Ibadan for repair. I\nprotested to the Manager of the S.C.O.A. who\nreleased the Peugeot to me and it was towed to\nIlorin.\"\nThe witness was severely and vigorously cross-\nexamined about Lieutenant Usman. In this\nconnection he stated, inter alia-\n\"I deny the suggestion that Usman was detained in\nIbadan for the purpose of being identified before\nbeing sent to Kwara State. I was told that Usman\nwas brought to\u00a0Ilorin by accused one. I checked the\nrecords at Ibadan and discovered that Usman was\ndetained for no offence committed. P.W. 2 was\narrested by accused one in Ibadan for an offence. I\ndo not know that P. W. 2 and Usman committed the\noffence.\"\n?Of the four policemen from Kwara arrested by the\nIbadan Police, the witness testified that the alleged\ncomplainants against them made statements to the\neffect that the policemen neither in fact demanded\nnor received any bribes from them. He testified as\nfollows:\n\"I telephoned to Ilorin from Ibadan that the men\n24\nwere arrested for no offence. I was not aware of\nthe signal sent to Ilorin from Ibadan about the\nidentity of the four men. One presented an identity\ncard, one a notebook and the four of them\nproduced their uniforms with their numbers on. The\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/66\nfirst day they were arrested Shangobiyi and Cpt.\nAdebiyi searched their house with the Army Sgt.\nand they saw their police uniforms with their\nnumbers on. They also saw the arms and\nammunition. It was after this search that they were\nlocked up. I do not know when they were locked\nup. Sangobiyi told me he was the one who arrested\nthem and locked them up. I did not know that the\norder of their detention came from Brisbie. I am\ninterested in all policemen. I feel sorry for them\nwhen I saw them. I was happy when I saw them. I\ndid not know whether they had food or not. I don't\nknow from where they were brought when they\nmet me at the office of accused one.\"\n?His evidence depicted the falsity of the charges\ntrumped-up against the four Kwara policemen and\nthis is confirmed in effect by the evidence of the\n11th P. W., Assistant Superintendent of Police\nShangobiyi and that of the 12th P.W. Police\nSergeant James Adebiyi. Evidence similar in nature\nand effect was also given by one of the policemen\nconcerned, i.e., Police Sergeant Alexander Agbenyo\n(P.W. 14) who said that for the three days of their\ndetention they were not given any food to eat.\n?Michael Oshineye Showale, Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police, Ibadan and the 13th P.W.\ntestified and produced in evidence the police station\n25\ncrime diary. Exhibit 31 containing entries for the\n7th April, 1971 which the policeman, Lamidi Lajide\n(P.W. 5), had tendered as (Exhibit 6). The witness\nShowale testified that although six persons\narrested on suspicion of preparing for the Kwara\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/66\nrobbery were arrested by the 1st and the 2nd\naccused persons on the 6th April, 1971 and were\nreleased on bail to Felix Dumeh on the instructions\nof the 1st accused on the 7th April,1971 there was\nan record of this in the crime diary, (exhibit 31)\nand that there was an record either of the arrest on\nthe instructions of the 1st accused of Mudashiru\nAjani Layiwola (P.W. 2) on the 6th April, 1971\nalthough there was an entry in (exhibit 31)\nshowing that on the 8th April, 1971 the 2nd P. W.\nwas released on bail, again on the instructions of\nthe 1st accused, to Abdulai Karimu-one of those\nwho actually participated in the robbery along the\nBacita Road on the 13th April, 1971. In the same\nway, the 13th P.W. stated that there was no record\nin (exhibit 31) of the arrest of the investigating\npolice officers from Ilorin who were arrested and\ndetained on the instructions of the 1st accused in\nthe Police cell at Ibadan.\n?As stated before, all the accused persons gave\nevidence at the trial and denied the charges and\nindeed the specific allegations against them by the\nseveral prosecution witnesses. When the 13th P.W.\nwas being cross-examined by learned counsel for\nthe 2nd accused, he stated that the police routine\ndiary, (exhibit 38) (which was produced in evidence\nby the Registrar of the High Court, Lagos) was the\n26\nproperty of the police and that entries No. 891 and\nNo. 892 therein, purported to show that the 2nd\naccused was at the police station, Ibadan, between\n8 p.m. and 8.40 p.m. on the 13th April, 1971\ncontrary to the prosecution story that the accused\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/66\npersons, all of them, were at that time at the house\nof Felix Dumeh taking an oath of secrecy and\nreceiving the amount of 5,000 pounds part of the\nloot of the robbery of that day.\nAfter the evidence\n?of the 1st accused and his witnesses, the 2nd\naccused, Y.L. Bello, gave evidence denying the\nallegations in the charges made against him. He\nstated that the 1st P. W., Adigun alias Balewa had\noccasion to tell lies against him because he, the\naccused person, was concerned with the\ninvestigation of the shop breaking case at Oyo and\nthe Feleye armed robbery. He called a witness who\nproduced the Station Diary (exhibit 38) and\nreferred to the Station Diary (exhibit 38) and relied\non it as evidence of the fact that at the time the\nprosecution said he was at the house of Felix\nDumeh he was indeed at the police station. The 3rd\naccused as well gave evidence in his defence and\ndenied the charges and the several allegations\nmade against him by the prosecution witnesses. He\nstated that the unsigned and undated statement\nallegedly made by him on the 5th July, 1971 was\nnot in fact his statement but that it was written by\nthe 8th P. W., P. P. O. Aremu and that he was only\nasked to sign it after having been tortured and\nrough handled by the Kwara police. He denied that\nhe dictated the contents of his statement exhibit 46\n27\nto the 8th P.W. The 4th D.W., Theophilus Odofin,\nan Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ibadan, gave\nevidence for the defence and stated that as far as\nhe was aware the complaint about non-cooperation\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n29/66\nwith the Kwara police against the Ibadan police was\nnot justified. The 4th accused person also gave\nevidence and called six witnesses. He described his\nown esteemed position in the local community and\ndenied the charges and the allegation made against\nhim by the prosecution witnesses, especially the\noath takings of the 9th April and the 13th April,\n1971 and the receipt of the amount of 5,000pounds\nfrom Felix Dumeh on the night of the 13th April,\n1971. Concerning his own statement admitted in\nevidence as exhibit 11 and making of it, the 4th\naccused testified thus; \"I followed P.W. 8 to the\npolice officers mess. We were surrounded with\narmed policemen. My right hand was taken out\nfrom handcuffs. P. W. 8 started to dictate what I\nshould write to me from certain paper. When I was\nwriting the statement the fear of further\npunishment was operating in my mind if I did not\nwrite the statement. Also the consequence of the\nrobbery charge was worrying me. I eventually\nwrote and signed exhibit 11. I wrote exhibit 11 on\nthe assurance of police protection. The contents of\nexhibit 11 are not true because they never\nhappened. My last sentence in exhibit 11 reads I do\nnot know anything about the robbery of 20,000\npounds.\"\n? Indeed, the 4th accused testified that on\nthe 13th April, 1971 he was at Ogere, his\nhome-town and had left Ibadan since 6.30 p.m. on\n28\nthat day; he had slept the night at Ogere and only\ncame back to Ibadan around 9 a.m. on the 14th\nApril, 1971. He admitted that it was true that the\n7th P. W. confronted him on the 26th May, 1971\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n30/66\nwith Felix Dumeh and stated that he denied there\nand then the allegations of Felix Dumeh. The 8th\nD.W., Julius Oyetunde Shobayo and the solicitor to\nthe 4th accused, testified in support of the 4th\naccused that he, witness, was with the 4th accused\non the 13th April, 1971 from about 3 p.m. to 11.30\np.m. In the same way the 9th D.W. Lasisi\nAshubiojo, a farmer of Ogere, the 10th D.W.,\nAlonge Adeneka, also a farmer of Ogere and the\n11th D. W., Alhaji Sule Balogun, an Arabic teacher\nof Ogere, all gave evidence of the effect that the\n4th accused was at Ogere on the evening of the\n13th April, 1971.\n?In a reserved judgment, in which the learned trial\njudge extensively analysed and appraised the\nevidence, he came to the conclusion that the\naccused persons were guilty of the charges against\nthem, and convicted them accordingly. He set out\nin a manner perhaps open to the blame of prolixity\nrather than that of inadvertence the evidence of\nthe several witnesses and dealt fully with the effect\nof the evidence of those witnesses one by one. With\nrespect to the actual robbery of the 13th April,\n1971, the learned trial judge found as follows-\n\"P.W. 2 and P.W. 3 impressed me as truthful\nwitnesses and were unshaken during the long and\nrigorous cross-examination and I accept their\nevidence. I find as a fact from the evidence of P. W.\n29\n3 that accused one and two used to visit P. W. 17\nwho was the master of P. W. 3. That at about 6\np.m. one day, accused four went to the house of\nP.W. 17 and asked for P. W. 17 from P. W. 3. That\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/66\non that occasion accused four wore a white guinea-\nbrocade garment. When P. W. 3 told accused four\nthat P.W. 17 was away to an hotel at Omitowoju,\naccused four told P.W.3 he was going to meet P. W.\n17 there. Accused four denied this incident. I do\nnot believe him.\nI am satisfied from the evidence of P. W. 2 and P.\nW. 3 that both accused one and two had prior\nknowledge of the robbery that took place on\n13-4-71 not earlier than 6-4-71 and both of them\nas police officers whose duty is to prevent\ncommission of crimes, did nothing to prevent the\nrobbery even though they knew and saw P. W. 17\nbefore 13-4-71.\"\n?The learned trial judge also\naccepted the evidence concerning the oath taking\nand concluded that all the four accused persons\nwere present in the house of the 17th P. W., Felix\nDumeh on the days and at the times stated by the\nprosecution for the ceremony of taking the oath\nand in respect of the 13th April, 1971, for receiving\nas well their own share the proceeds of the\nrobbery. He expressly rejected the entries Nos. 891\nand 892 in the station diary, (Ex. 38), concerning\nthe movement on that night of the 2nd accused. He\ntook the view that first and foremost in order to\nprove its authenticity, the writer of the entry\nshould have been called but he was not called. The\nlearned trial judge found that the statement (Ex.\n30\n7), which was most damaging against the 3rd\naccused person, was written by him in his own\nhand-writing and rejected his attempts to resile\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/66\nfrom that statement at his trial. He also considered\nthe statement of the 4th accused, (Ex. 11) dated\nand written by the 4th accused himself and came to\nthe conclusion that that statement was a free and\nvoluntary expression of the mind of the 4th\naccused person proceeding from remorse rather\nthan from fear or any inducement or promise and\nthat the half-truths it told were as damaging as\never to the case of the 4th accused. The learned\ntrial judge concluded on this aspect of the case\nthus:\n\"I am of the view that the contents of exhibit 11\nare direct, positive and unequivocal in regard to the\npart which he played at the house of P. W. 17 on\n13-4-71. I do not believe accused four when he\nsaid that he did not take oath on 13-4-71 in the\nhouse of P. W. 17, that he did not receive money\nfrom P. W. 17 on 13-4-71 and that he was at Ogere\nholding meeting when he was supposed to be in the\nhouse of P.W. 17\".\n?Also in the course of his judgment, the learned trial\njudge was at pains to consider the implications of\nthe offence of abetment by conspiracy. He took the\nview that the four accused persons were engaged in\na criminal conspiracy by which they promised\nprotection from detection to the robbers who did\nthe act of the 13th April, 1971 along Bacita Road,\nswore to protect the arch-robber and to assure him\nof their continued intention to give him the\n31\nprotection which he most ardently required and\nthat some of the conspirators, admittedly by virtue\nof their positions as policemen, actively obstructed\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n33/66\nthe investigation of the robbery by those who were\nlawfully engaged in carrying out such investigation.\nThe learned trial judge concluded this part of the\njudgment with the following observations:\n\"I am therefore satisfied that the four accused\npersons abetted the commission of the robbery by\nP. W. 17 and three others on 13-4-71 between\nIlorin and Bacita. The prosecution has therefore\nproved the essential ingredients on count one. I\nfind the four accused persons guilty on count one\nas charged contrary to\u00a0Sections 85 and 298 (b) of\nthe Penal Code.\"\n?With respect to the charge of receiving, the\nlearned trial judge recounted the story of the night\nof the 13th April, 1971 and the visit to the house of\nthe 17th P.W., Felix Dumeh, the oath-taking that\nthere and then took place and the consequent\ndeparture from there with a parcel containing an\namount of 5,000 pounds. He found all four accused\npersons guilty of receiving under Section 317 of the\nPenal Code. He also found the 1st accused guilty on\ncounts 4, 5, 7 and 9; the 2nd accused guilty as well\non counts 4, 5, 7 and 9; the 3rd accused guilty as\nwell on counts 4, 5, 7 and 9 and the 4th accused\nguilty as well on counts 4 and 6. He discharged and\nacquitted them on the other counts of the charge\non which they were respectively charged. He\nconvicted them on the counts on which he found\nthem guilty and sentenced them accordingly.\n32\nThis appeal is from that judgment. Before us,\nlearned counsel appearing for the accused persons\nfiled many grounds of appeal containing complaints\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n34/66\nagainst the facts as found by the learned trial judge\nand the law as applied by him to those facts. We\ngranted leave generally to counsel to argue the\nfacts as well as the law and allowed the inclusion of\nas many new and additional grounds of appeal as\ncounsel would like to canvass.\nAll counsel are together in arguing that the\noffences with which the accused persons were\ncharged and tried are not cognisable by the Penal\nCode. At the inception of the appeal, the learned\nDirector of Public Prosecution of the Kwara Sate, Mr\nEkundayo, appearing for the State, informed us\nthat he was not supporting the conviction of the\naccused persons on counts 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9\nand asked for their discharge on those accounts.\nWe propose to make the necessary order on this at\nthe end of this judgment.\n?Before us it was argued certainly on behalf of the\n1st and 4th accused persons and presumably on\nbehalf of the other accused persons, that the High\nCourt, Ilorin should not have exercised its\njurisdiction to try the accused persons on the\noffences charged since they were not offences\ncontemplated by the Penal Code of Northern\nNigeria which is applicable in Kwara State. It was\nsubmitted that the offences of which the accused\npersons were tried and convicted, that is to say\nabetment under count No.1 and receiving under\n33\ncount No.2, are by virtue of the provisions of\nSection 4 (2) of the Penal Code Law such as are not\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n35/66\npostulated by the Penal Code. Section 4 of the\nPenal Code Law, Cap. 89, reads as follows:\n\"4 (1) Where by the provisions of any law of\nNorthern Nigeria the doing of any act or the\nmaking of any omission is made an offence those\nprovisions shall apply to every person who is in\nNorthern Nigeria at the time of his doing the act or\nmaking the omission.\n(2) Where any such offence comprises several\nelements and any acts, omissions or events occur\nwhich, if occurred in Northern Nigeria would be\nelements of the offence, occur elsewhere than in\nNorthern Nigeria then,\n(a) if the act or omission, which in the case of an\noffence committed wholly in Northern Nigeria would\nbe the initial element of the offence, occurs in\nNorthern Nigeria, the person who does that act or\nmakes that omission is guilty of an offence of the\nsame kind and is liable to the same punishment as\nif all the subsequent elements of the offence\noccurred in Northern Nigeria; and\n(b) if that act or omission occurs elsewhere than in\nNorthern Nigeria, and the person who does that act\nor makes that omission afterwards enters Northern\nNigeria, he is by such entry guilty of an offence of\nthe same kind, and is liable to the same\npunishment, as if that act or omission had occurred\nin Northern Nigeria and he had been in Northern\nNigeria when it occurred.\n(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sub-Section\n34\n(2) it shall be a defence to the charge in any such\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n36/66\ncase to prove that the person accused did not\nintend that the act or omission should have effect\nin Northern Nigeria.\n(4) The provisions of Sub-Section (2) do not extend\nto a case in which the only material event that\noccurs in Northern Nigeria is the death of a person\nwhose death is caused by an act or omission at a\nplace outside, and at a time when that person was\noutside, Northern Nigeria.\"\n?In the course of his argument on this ground of\nappeal learned counsel for the 1st and the 4th\naccused persons submitted that as no \"initial\nelement\"of the offences under the 1st and the 2nd\ncounts occurred in Kwara State, the\u00a0Section does\nnot apply the Penal Code to the acts and/or\nomissions of the accused persons. The learned\nDirector of Public Prosections contended however\nthat the \"initial elements\" of the offences under the\n1st and the 2nd counts occurred in the Kwara State\nand that the offences come within the purview of\nSection 4 (2) (a) and (b) of the Penal \u00a0Code Law and\nare therefore punishable by the Penal Code.\n?Admittedly Section 4 (2) of the Penal Code Law is\nnot easy to construe. The\u00a0Section is concerned with\nan offence that comprises several elements and\nidentifies these elements with \"acts, omissions or\nevents\". It is clear therefore that the \"element\" in\nthe\u00a0Section is more widely conceived and is not and\nshould not be limited to either an actus reus or the\nmens rea in conventional criminal jurisprudence.\nThe \"initial element\" to which reference is made in\n35\nthe\u00a0Section is the initial act or omission concerned\nand for the purpose of applying Section 4 (2) it is\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n37/66\nnecessary to look for that \"initial element\". If (a)\nthat \"initial act or omission\" occurs in the State\neven though the other \"elements\" do not, the\nperson who does that \"initial act or omission\" is\npunishable by the State under the Penal Code; on\nthe other hand, if (b) that \"initial act or omission\"\noccurs outside the State, the other or others\noccurring within the State and the person who does\nthat \"initial act or omission\" afterwards enters the\nState, he is by such entry triable by the State\nunder the Penal Code. The learned Director of\nPublic Prosecutions has submitted that with respect\nto the charge of abetment in the first count the\naccused person are liable under the Penal Code by\nvirtue of Section 4 (2) (b) of the Penal Code Law\nand that with respect to the charge of receiving in\nthe 2nd count they are triable under the Penal\nCode by virtue of Section 4 (2) (a) of the Penal\nCode Law. Learned counsel for the accused persons\ncontended otherwise and submitted in effect that,\nwith respect to both counts, none of the elements\noccured in Kwara State and that Section 4 (2) (b)\ncould not in any case apply because the accused\npersons had come into Kwara State involuntarily by\nbeing arrested by the police and taken thereto and\ntherefore did not \"enter\" Kwara State as required\nor contemplated by\u00a0Section 4 (2) (b) of the Penal\nCode Law.\n?We cannot of course agree with the contention of\nlearned counsel for the accused persons. Section 4\n36\n(2) (b) of the Penal Code Law which deals with\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n38/66\ncases in which the \"initial element\" occurs outside\nthe State, does require that the person who does\nthat act or omission should \"afterwards enter\" the\nState before being triable or punishable under the\nPenal Code.\nThe learned Director of Public Prosecutions\nsubmitted on this aspect of the case that any mode\nof entry is sufficient for the purpose of the\u00a0Section\nand that even if the accused persons were\nkidnapped and brought into the State they have\nindeed entered the State within the meaning and\nintent of the provisions of Section (4) (2) (b) of the\nPenal Code. We are satisfied ourselves that to\nconstrue the word \"enter\" in the subsection as\nmeaning only a voluntary entry would be\ncompletely ridiculous since in that circumstance no\ncriminal will ever enter the State when he knows\nor realises that such entry may make him triable by\nthe laws of the State.\nLearned counsel for the 1st and the 4th accused\npersons had referred us to the position in England\nand had cited in aid of his argument Section 7 and\nSection 9 of the English Accessories and Abettors\nAct, 1861. We observe in connection with this\nenactment that\u00a0Section 9 refers only to accessories\nwith respect to\u00a0admiralty offences and that even\nSection 7 provides that an accessory may be tried\nas well \"in any country or place in which such\nperson shall be apprehended or be in custody\". In\nEngland now, a place of trial is normally regulated\nby Section 11(1) of the Criminal Justice Act (1925)\n37\nwhich provides as follows:\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n39/66\n''A person charged with any indictable offence\nmay be proceeded against, indicted, tried and\npunished in any country or place in which he was\napprehended, or is in custody on a charge for the\noffence, or has appeared in answer to a summons\nlawfully issued charging the offence, as if the\noffence had been committed in that country or\nplace, and the offence shall, for all purposes\nincidental to or consequential on the prosecution,\ntrial or punishment thereof, be deemed to have\nbeen committed in that country or place.\"\n?\nLooking back at Section 4 (2) (b) of the Penal\nCode Law we are of the view that the entry\npostulated by the\u00a0Sub-Section is not necessarily a\nvoluntary entry and, whether the offender be\napprehended in the State or be in custody in the\nState, his entry is complete within the purpose and\nintent custody in the State, his entry is complete\nwithin the purpose and intent of the subsection and\nhe is triable in the State under the Penal Code.\n?It is pertinent at this juncture to point out that\nthe arguments of learned counsel for the accused\npersons overlook the actual facts of the case. The\nevidence of the prosecution as to the entry of the\naccused person into Kwara State has been\nreproduced by us earlier on in this judgment. That\nevidence is to the effect that all the accused\npersons were arrested in the Kwara State and that\nall had come into Kwara State by themselves at\ndifferent times in different ways. The evidence is\nalso to the effect that the accused persons were not\n38\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n40/66\narrested before they entered into Kwara State.\nThere was positive evidence by the 7th P. W. that\nthe 3rd accused went on his own to Ilorin on the\n3rd July, 1971 that the 1st accused went to Ilorin\nin his own car with Lieutenant Usman on the 18th\nMay, 1971 P.W.7. The prosecution evidence is also\nto the effect that the 4th accused went to Ilorin on\nthe 26th May, 1971 in his own Mercedes Benz car,\nWR 6666 8th P. W. The 2nd accused himself stated\nin his evidence that he went on his own to Ilorin on\nthe 5th July, 1971 on the instructions of his boss. It\nseems to us clear therefore that the argument\nconcerning the voluntariness or otherwise of the\nentry of the accused persons into the Kwara State,\ndid not strictly speaking arise on the facts of this\ncase but it is well to point out that our view of the\nsubsection is that any type of entry would satisfy\nthe\u00a0Section, the important factor being the\navailability of the accused person for trial within\nthe State.\nThe accused persons are charged on the 1st count\nwith abetment under Section 85 of the Penal Code.\nThat\u00a0Section reads as follows:\n\"85. Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act\nabetted is committed in consequence of the\nabetment and no express provision is made by this\nPenal Code or by any other law for the time being\nin force for the punishment of such abetment, be\npunished with the punishment provided for the\noffence.\"\n?It is obvious that the\u00a0Section requires that, apart\nfrom the abetment, the act abetted should have\n39\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n41/66\nbeen actually committed. The\u00a0Section requires the\nproof not only of the acts or omissions constituting\nthe abetment but also of the commission of the act\nabetted in consequence of the abetment. This\nindeed was the contention of the learned Director\nof Public Prosecutions who also pointed out that the\nrobbery manifestly committed in the Kwara State\non 13th April, 1971 is an element of the offence\ncontemplated by\u00a0Section 85 of the Penal Code. We\ndo not agree with the submissions of learned\ncounsel for the accused persons that no element of\nthe charge of abetment under\u00a0Section 85 (as\nopposed to abetment under\u00a0Section 91) of the Penal\nCode had taken place within the Kwara State. It is\nsignificant that Dr Alan Gledhill in his book entitled\n\"The Penal Codes of Northern Nigeria and the\nSudan\" in illustrating the meaning and effect of\nSection 4 (2) gives the following example at p. 775-\n\"If A in the Western Region instigates B to commit\nrobbery in the Northern Region and the robbery is\ncommitted and, after the instigation, A enters the\nNorthern Region, A is punishable under Section 91,\nN.N.P.C.\nIf A writes a letter in Northern Nigeria and posts it\nto B, who receives it in the Western Region, the\ncontents being an instigation to B to do something\nin Western Nigeria which, if committed in Northern\nNigeria, would be an offence, A would be\npunishable under Section 91, N. N . P . C. , the\ninstigation is not complete until B has read the\nmessage; the initial element in the act of\ninstigation, the posting of the letter, was done in\n40\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n42/66\nNorthern Nigeria.\"\nSection 4 (2) of the Penal Code Law does not deal\nwith venue but with guilt and it would be doing\nviolence to its purpose and import to construe it\nwith an eye on excluding rather than asserting the\napplicability of the Penal Code. The principles\nembodied in this section are well known and are\nuniversally recognised. See R. v. Ellis (1899) 1\nQ.B.230: also The King v. Oliphant [1905] 2\nK.B.67. In\u00a0a\u00a0charge\u00a0of\u00a0abetment\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0offence\u00a0the\n\"initial\u00a0element\"\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0instigation\u00a0or\u00a0positive\u00a0act\u00a0of\nencouragement\u00a0to\u00a0do\u00a0the\u00a0act\u00a0or\u00a0omission\u00a0which\nconstitutes\u00a0the\u00a0offence. By the charge in count 1,\nthe prosecution case is that the accused persons\nare in a conspiracy by which they instigated those\nwho committed the robbery of the 13th April, 1971\nto do so and promised to protect them from\ndetection and/or prosecution. Obviously the \"initial\nelement\" took place outside the Kwara State but\nthe act abetted, an element of the charge under\nSection 85, took place in Kwara State. We have\nearlier on made our own analysis of the meaning of\nSection 4 (2) of the Penal Code Law and for the\nreasons which we have set out as well we are\nfirmly of the view that\u00a0Section 4 (2) of the Penal\nCode clearly covers the charge on count 1 with\nwhich the accused persons are charged and that by\nvirtue of that\u00a0Sub-Section, they are properly triable\nfor an offence under the Penal Code. See also in\nthis connection, the judgment of this\u00a0Court in\nOlusegun Haruna v. The State (1972) 8/9 S.C. 192\net seq. The accused persons are charged on the 2nd\n41\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n43/66\ncount with receiving under Section 317 of the Penal\nCode. That Section of the Penal Code is in the\nconventional form and reads thus;\n\"317. Whoever dishonestly receives or retains any\nstolen property knowing or having reasons to\nbelieve the same to be stolen property shall be\npunished with imprisonment for a term which may\nextend to fourteen years or with fine or with both.\"\n?It was submitted by the learned Director of Public\nProsecutions that the robbery committed was the\n\"initial element\" of the charge of receiving whilst\nlearned counsel for the accused persons argued\nthat the offence of receiving had nothing to do with\nthe robbery committed. By the provisions of Section\n317 and in order to sustain a charge under that\nsection, the prosecution must prove that the\nreceiver knows that the property he was receiving\nwas \"stolen property\" and in the case in hand the\nprosecution has set out to prove that the accused\npersons knew that the amount of 5,000 pounds\nwhich they received in the evening of the 13th\nApril, 1971 was part of the money which the\nrobbers stole along Bacita Road in the morning of\nthe same day as alleged in the charge. A parcel\ncontaining the money was identified all the way by\nprosecution witnesses and indeed it was not argued\nbefore us that the identity of the parcel and its\ncontents should be or was infact in any doubt. We\nhold therefore that the argument against the\napplicability of Section 4 (2) (a) of the Penal Code\nLaw fails and that that subsection makes the\naccused persons triable for an offence under\u00a0Section\n42\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n44/66\n317 of the Penal Code.\n? A number of other points of\nlaw and facts were raised and it is sufficient to say\nthat many of them are either valueless or\nmisconceived in view of the facts of the case which\nthey have overlooked. There are however some of\nthese points with which we propose to deal before\ndealing with the facts of the case and the\napplication of the learned trial judge of the relevant\nrules of law to those facts.\nIt was contended for instance that the statement of\nthe 4th accused person, (Exhibit. 11), was inadmissible\nin as much as it does not comply with the\nrequirements of Section 126 of the Criminal\nProcedure Code, Cap. 30, Laws of Northern Nigeria.\nIn the High Court objection was taken to the\nproduction in evidence of this statement on the\ngrounds that the statement was not voluntary and\nthat the accused person had been tortured into\nmaking the statement which in any case is a\nstatement made to a person in authority within the\ncontext of Section 27 of the Evidence Law, Cap. 40\n(Laws of Northern Nigeria) \u00a0.The learned trial judge\nseparately tried this issue as a trial within a trial\nand ruled that the statement was made voluntarily\nby the 4th accused person. As stated before, the\ncontention before us is that the statement being a\nconfessional statement was inadmissible because it\nwas not taken down or employed in accordance\nwith the provisions of Section 126 of the Criminal\nProcedure Code. That\u00a0Section reads as follows:\n''126 (1) If any person in the course of an\ninvestigation under Section 118 or at any time after\n43\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n45/66\nthe close of the investigation but before the\ncommencement of any inquiry or trial confesses to\nthe commission of an offence in connection with the\nsubject-matter of the investigation, a police officer\nmay, instead of taking the person before a justice\nof the peace, record such confession in the case\ndiary in his own handwriting in the presence of the\nperson making the confession and after reading\nover to that person such record shall require him to\nsign or seal it and the police officer shall also sign\nit.\n(2) No police officer shall record any such\nconfession unless after questioning the person\nmaking it he is satisfied that it is made voluntarily.\n(3) No oath shall be administered to any person\nmaking such confession.\n(4) Subject to the provisions of the Evidence Law\nand of any rules made under paragraph (f) of\nSub-Section (1) of \u00a0Section 373 of this Code, the\nrecord of a confession in the case diary if made by\na police officer in accordance with this section shall\nbe admissible as evidence against the person who\nmade the confession and if so admitted shall be\nread out in\u00a0Court.\"\n?Manifestly the\u00a0Section prescribes\nthe mode of recording and dealing with a\nconfession made by an accused person before his\ntrial. We have looked at the statement, (Exhibit 11),\nourselves. It is true that the statement admits\nmany of the facts put in evidence by the\nprosecution and indeed admits the presence of the\n4th accused in the house of Felix Dumeh on the\nnight of the 13th April, 1971 and a description of\n44\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n46/66\nthe oath-taking ceremony in which himself\nparticipated, but we are of the view that the\nstatement does not \"confess\" to the commission of\nany offence with which the accused is charged and\ncontains no positive and direct admission that the\naccused person had committed the crimes described\nin the charge sheet against him in the context of\nthe decision of the Federal Supreme Court in Raimi\nAdebisi Afolabi v. The Commissioner of Police [1961]\nAll N. L. R. 654 (see per Taylor, F.J. at pp. 657\n-658). If this is so, then prima facie, the\u00a0Section\ndoes not apply to the statement (Exhibit 11) and the\ntaking down or making of that statement.\n?But, nonetheless, we think we should consider the\nsubmissions of learned counsel on the assumption\nthat the statement, (Exhibit 11), was a confession. The\nstatement, exhibit 11, was written by the accused\nperson himself and before proceeding to write the\nsubstantive parts of it, he signed a statement of the\nwords of caution which the 8th P. W., Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police, Jimoh Aremu had already\nwritten on the top of the form. What the witness\nsaid in evidence was that the 4th accused sent for\nhim on the morning of the 6th June, 1971 and told\nhim \"that he wanted to make another statement in\naddition to the one he had made earlier.\" There\nwas no question of the 4th accused person\nconfessing \"to the commission of an offence\" which\nis a pre-condition of the applicability of\u00a0Section 126\nof the Criminal Procedure Code. We think that\nSection 126 of the Code applies only where the\naccused person \"confesses to the commission of the\n45\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n47/66\noffence in connection with the subject-matter of\nthe investigation\" and not in a case where, like\nthis, all the accused person had said was that he\nwanted to make an additional statement. Rather we\nthink that in the circumstances described by the\n8th P.W., Section 124 (2) of the Criminal Procedure\nCode applied and that\u00a0Section provides as follows:\n\"124 (2) No police officer or other person shall\nprevent any person from making in the course of\nthe investigation any statement in accordance with\nany rules made under Section 373 which of his own\nfree will he may be disposed to make.\"\nNow, Section 124(2) refers to the Section 373 of\nthe Criminal Procedure Code,\u00a0Sub-Section (1) of\nwhich gives the Chief Justice of the Northern States\npower to make Rules of Court for;\n\"373 (1) The Chief Justice with the approval of that\nGovernor may make rules of\u00a0Court for all or any of\nthe following purposes\n(f) prescribing the conditions under which\nstatements may be made to the police by accused\nand other persons and under which such\nstatements may be admitted in evidence.\"\nRules have indeed been made by the Chief Justice\nin virtue of those powers. The Rules are the\nCriminal Procedure (Statement to Police Officers)\nRules No. 11 of 1960 and\u00a0Rules 6 and 9 of those\nRules read:\n\"6. A person against whom a police officer had\ndecided to make a complaint and who makes a\nvoluntary statement shall not be cross-examined,\nand no question shall be put to him about such\n46\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n48/66\nstatement except for the purpose of removing\nambiguity in what he has actually said.\n9. Save as provided in the Evidence Ordinance, no\nstatement made to a police officer by a person\nagainst whom the has decided to make a complaint\nshall be admissible in evidence in anyCourt unless\nsuch statement is made in accordance with these\nrules. \"\nIt will be observed thatSection 126 (4) of the\nCriminal Procedure Code has let in the provisions of\nthe Evidence Law and the admissibility of a record\nmade in the Crime Diary is expressly made subject\nto the Evidence Law and the Rules made under\nSection 373 (1) (f) of the Criminal Procedure Code.\nIt is remarkable thatRule 6 of the Criminal\nProcedure (Statements to Police Officers) Rules,\nNo. 11 of 1960, provides for the making of a\nvoluntary statement by an accused person andRule\n9 of those Rules subjects the admissibility of that\nstatement to the Rules, i.e. No. 11 of 1960 which\nagain refers to the Evidence Law. Indeed, that was\nthe basis of the decision of this Court in Peter Uche\nand Anor. v. The Queen [1964] 1 All N.L.R. 195\nwhere at pp. 198-199 the Court, whilst discussing\nthe admissibility of a confessional statement made\nby an accused person himself without complying\nwith the provisions ofSection 126, observed as\nfollows:\n\"These rules were not referred to by the learned\ncounsel on either side; the view we are taking is\nwithout the aid of argument. Seeing that the\nprovisions of the Evidence Ordinance are saved by\n47\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n49/66\nRule 9, we think that a confession which is\nadmissible under that Ordinance may, though not\nrecorded in writing, be received in evidence. We do\nnot know of any decision that evidence of an oral\nconfession which was made after caution and was\nfree and voluntary cannot be given if it is not\nrecorded and signed; nor was it as argued.\"\nOur observations would have covered the\nargument of learned counsel for the accused person\nand constituted a complete answer to the argument\nagainst the admissibility of (Exhibit 11) as undoubtedly\nthat statement was made in conformity with the\nprovisions of\u00a0Section 27 (2) of the Evidence Law,\nCap. 40, Laws of Northern Nigeria. Actually when\nUche's case, supra, was decided in June 1964 the\nattention of the Court was not drawn to the fact\nthat Section 122 to which Section 126 is supposed\nto be an exception, had been amended to read as\nfollows:\n\"122 (1) Nothing in any way included in or forming\npart of a case diary shall be admissible in evidence\nin any inquiry or trial unless it is admissible under\nthe provisions of the Evidence Ordinance or of this\nCriminal Procedure Code or of rules made\nthereunder, but\n(a) a\u00a0Court may if it shall think fit order the\nproduction of the case diary for its inspection under\nthe provisions of\u00a0Section 144;\n(b) the Attorney-General may at any time order\nthe submission of the case diary to himself;\n(c) any relevant part of the case diary may be used\nby a police officer who made the same to refresh\n48\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n50/66\nhis memory if called as a witness.\n(2) Save to the extent that:\n(a) anything in any way included in or forming part\nof a case diary is admitted in evidence in any\ninquiry or trial in pursuance of the provisions of\nSub-Section (1); or\n(b) the case diary is used for the purposes set out\nin paragraph (c) of \u00a0Sub-Section (1), the accused or\nhis agent shall not be permitted to call for or\ninspect such case diary or any part thereof but,\nwhere for the purposes of paragraph (a) or (b) any\nsuch inspection is permitted, such inspection shall\nbe limited to the part of the case diary referred to\nin paragraph (a) or (b) as the case may be.\"\nThe amendment obviously makes admissible such\nstatements as are rendered admissible by the\nEvidence Law and disposes of the other argument\nof learned counsel for the accused person that\nSection 9 of the Criminal Procedure (Statements to\nPolice Officers) Rules No. 11 of 1960 is invalid\ninasmuch as it is inconsistent with the specific\nprovisions of Sections 125 and 126 of the Penal\nCode. This is so because the amended\u00a0Section 122\nof the Criminal Procedure Code validates the\nreference to the Evidence Law and gives effect in\nstatutory form to the provisions of Section 9 of\nthose Rules, i.e. No. 11 of 1960.\n?Learned counsel for the 4th accused also argued\nthat the statement, (Exhibit. 11), could not have been\nvoluntary and referred to the beginning of it which\nreads thus\n\"I made a statement to the police at Ilorin before\n49\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n51/66\nthis one on 30-5-71, I now decided to tell the police\nall I know about the case for which I am being\nquestioned. I would have stated the fact if not for\nthe fear that the senior police officers involved will\nvictimize or trouble me and my people at Ibadan.\nHaving been given full assurance by the police in\nIlorin that no one can victimize me and my people\nif I speak the truth, I have now decided to speak\nthe truth to the best of my knowledge about this\ncase. I am now speaking the truth and nothing but\nthe truth.\"\n?This introductory portion, learned counsel states,\nsuggests that the accused was making the\nstatement under a promise or reward for doing so.\nWe do not think so. We are of the view that the\nstatement had proceeded, as we stated before,\nfrom remorse rather than from inducement. If the\npolice promised to him do any favours and\ntherefore induced him to make the statement, the\npolice would have told him there and then that the\nintroductory passage falsifies the entire statement\nand makes it worthless and undeserving of the\ninducement. The accused person was literate and\nhad written out the statement himself and if one\nreads the whole statement it is apparent that most\nof the contents were not matters which in any view\nof this case would have interested the police.\n?Arguments similar to those in connection with the\n4th accused and his statement were put forward by\nlearned counsel both for the 2nd and the 3rd\naccused persons in the case. In particular, the\nstatements of the 3rd accused person, exhibit 7 and\n50\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n52/66\nexhibit 46, were challenged although learned\ncounsel himself conceded that exhibit 7 and exhibit\n46 are not confessional statements. Clearly, if that\nis so, Section 126 of the Criminal Procedure Code\nwould be irrelevant. The voluntariness of the\nstatements (Exhibit 7 & 46), like that of (Exhibit 11), was\nseparately tried by the learned trial judge and we\ncan see nothing exceptionable in his rulings on\nboth statements which in both cases were written\nby literate and experienced men fully aware of\ntheir contents and legal consequences. In the\ncourse of the trial and in order to sustain his alibi,\nthat he was not in the house of Felix Dumeh to\ntake any oath on the night of the 13th April, 1971\nthe 2nd accused person caused to be produced in\nevidence the station diary in use at the police\nstation, Ibadan, where entries Nos. 891 and 892\nrecorded that he was inside the police station on\nduty between 20.00 hours (i.e. 8 p.m.) and 20.40\nhours (8.40 p.m.). The station diary was produced\nas exhibit 38 and concerning that exhibit, the\nlearned trial judge in the course of his judgment\nobserved as follows-\n\"If these two entries are true why did accused two\nfail to call the writer? If accused two was visited in\nthis house at 9.40 p.m. by the patrol why did he\nnot call Sgt. Ogunwoye who headed the patrol and\nreported to him? If he remained in his house\nthroughout the night of 13-4-71, why did he not\ncall anyone from his house who saw him\nthroughout the night as a witness? I do not believe\naccused two and I attach no weight or important to\n51\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n53/66\nentry Nos. 891 and 892 of (Exhibit 38).\"\nOn this aspect of the case, learned counsel for the\n2nd accused submitted that the learned trial judge\nhad wrongly placed the onus of proving his alibi on\nthe accused person instead of the prosecution. We\nare clearly of the view that the argument is\nmisconceived. The learned trial judge urged the\npoints which he had made in order to spot-light the\napparently meagre probative value of (Exhibit. 38). The\nmaker of the record was not called to give\nevidence. Although the 4th D. W., Assistant\nCommissioner of Police Odofin, had stated\nconcerning (Exhibit. 38) as follows:\n\"By entry 982 in (Exhibit. 38), Bello must remain in his\nhouse as he was on duty. Accused two was a very\ngood officer.\"\nThe accused person made no efforts whatsoever to\nestablish the fact of his being at home or at the\npolice station-which facts must be and are facts\npeculiarly within his own knowledge.

The\npolice officer who took the statements was asked\nwhether he had done anything to check their truth\nand said that he had not and it was submitted that\nfor this reason justice had been denied to the\nappellants and there should at least have been a\nreasonable doubt as to their guilt. There are\noccasions on which a failure to check an alibi may\ncast doubt on the reliability of the case for the\nprosecution, but in a ease such as this where the\nappellants were identified by three eyewitnesses\nthere was a straight issue of credibility and we are\nnot able to say that the judge's findings of fact\nwere unreasonable or cannot be supported having\nregard to the evidence. If the alibis had been true it\nwould have been open to the appellants to call\nwitnesses in support of them and neither of them\ndid so.\"\nWe think that the entries in exhibit 38 are\nnot proved, much less the implications of those\nentries; that the comments of the learned trial\njudge on the worthlessness of the entries are\njustified and that no rule of law is breached or\ninfringed by these comments. These observations\nalso apply to the alibi set up by the 4th accused\nand the complaint against the decision of the\nlearned trial judge on this aspect of his case. The\nprosecution investigated the alibi, as they ought to\n53\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n55/66\ndo, and left the result to theCourt on the basis of\nthe evidence available both from the prosecution\nand the accused person himself. The learned trial\njudge heard the evidence on all sides and\ndisbelieved and rejected the evidence of the\ndefence witnesses who had come to support the\nalibi of the 4th accused. In other words, the\nevidence accepted by the learned trial judge fixed\nthe 4th accused in Ibadan in the house of Felix\nDumeh at the time when he tried to suggest that\nhe could not have been in Ibadan. This was a\nstraight issue of fact and the learned trial judge\nsaw and heard the witnesses before him. We are\nsatisfied that the learned trial judge was not shown\nto have erred in any way in his conclusions in this\nrespect.\n??It has also been argued for the accused persons\nthat the statements of the 1st and the 17th\nprosecution witnesses to the police were not\nadmissible, that some statements made to the\npolice by the 8th P. W. were asked for but were not\nordered to be produced, that some of the\nprosecution witnesses were either expert or\napprentice robbers or dangerously aggrieved or\nvindictive persons whose evidence should not have\nbeen accepted and if accepted should have been\nsubjected to corroboration by the learned trial\njudge in order to justify his acceptance and so on.\nWe do not think that these submissions deserve\nmore than passing observation. The statement\nmade by the 1st P. W. to the police was indeed\nasked for by learned counsel and the statement of\n54\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n56/66\nthe 17th P. W. was admitted in evidence for the\npurpose of cross-examining Felix Dumeh after the\nprosecution had duly obtained the leave ofCourt to\ntreat Felix Dumeh as a hostile witness. Besides\nthis, it should be remembered that the learned trial\njudge completely rejected the evidence of the 17th\nP. W., Felix Dumeh, in his judgment and there is\ntherefore no reason whatsoever to complain about\nthe admission in evidence of his statement. With\nrespect to the requests for the production of written\nstatements which were refused, including the\napplication for the 1st P.W. to exhibit his bare back\nfor the purpose of ascertaining whether or not he\nhad whip-stripes thereon, we are of the view that\nthe several rulings of the learned trial judge on\nthese issues are sound in the circumstances and no\nargument of any substance has been addressed to\nus to disparage those rulings. Concerning the bad\ncharacter of some of the prosecution witnesses, we\ncannot see the wood for the trees in the complaint\nof counsel. It is true that both the famous and the\ninfamous gave evidence at the trial of the accused\npersons. When it is proposed to give evidence of\nthe happenings inside hell it is only a matter of\ncommon sense to call one of the inmates of that\nplace or one whose business is carried out in\nreasonable propinquity to hell and it must be\nsurprising indeed to find even a lone angel fit and\nqualified for the assignment. Indeed it would be\npreposterous to look for such evidence in other\ndirections. The 1st P.W., Mustapha Adigun alias\nBalewa, the 2nd P.W., Mudashiru Layiwola and the\n55\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n57/66\n3rd P.W., Chukwuemeka Onyemeche, are not\naccomplices in the charges before the\u00a0Court and it\nis wrong to describe them as such. They may on\naccount of their criminal habituality tend to tell lies\nagainst policemen whose duty it is to bring them to\nbook and indeed they may tell lies in order to serve\nother purposes of their own or to wreak vengeance\non innocent policemen; but these are issues of\ncredibility and the ascription of probative values to\noral evidence is pre-eminently the duty of the trial\njudge. In the present case, the learned trial judge\nheard these witnesses and concluded either that\ntheir testimonies corroborated the statements of\nthe accused persons or vice versa and we are\nunable to see any justifiable grounds of complaints\nin the circumstances.\n? Lastly, it was argued for the\naccused persons that the judgment or verdict is not\njustified by the evidence. On the 1st count the\naccused persons were charged as stated before with\nabetment under\u00a0Section 85 of the Penal Code and\nthe learned trial judge makes it clear that he was\nconvicting them of abetment by conspiracy. He\nstated in the course of his judgment that\n\"By Section 83 (b) of the Penal Code and on the\nauthority of Doso Awanze and 6 Ors. v. Tiv Native\nAuthority (1966) N.M.L.R. 197, to constitute an\nabetment, the accused persons must have engaged\nin conspiracy with P. W. 17.''\nThe learned trial judge then discussed the\nimplications of a conspiracy and observed that the\nconspirators must have engaged in some act or\nomission in pursuance of the conspiracy and that\n56\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n58/66\nthere is no conspiracy as long as it rests on\nintention only.

In this case the charge is\none of abetment, i.e. that the accused persons\n57\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n59/66\nconspired together to abet this robbery and that\nthey did so having had previous knowledge of the\nrobbery and according to the wording of the charge\nby \"intentionally aiding, encouraging and\ninstigating the commission of the said offence by\nagreeing with Felix Dumeh and others and\npromising on oath to conceal the said offence when\ncommited and by taking no action to prevent its\ncommission\", and it must be proved either that all\ndid the acts or omissions set out in the charge or\nthat some or one of them did such acts or\nomissions in the name of all and in furtherance of\nthe common design of all. It is part of the case for\nthe prosecution in this case that all the accused\nmet in the house of Felix Dumeh some time in\nFebruary, 1971 and there agreed by the taking of\nan oath that they would ensure protection from\ndetection to the robbers. The evidence of this had\ncome from Felix Dumeh himself from what the 8th\nP. W. described as the result of confronting the\naccused persons with Felix Dumeh and the\nevidence of the 3rd P. W. that even in the month of\nFebruary, 1971 all the accused persons had met in\nthe house of Felix Dumeh and were frequenting his\nhouse and that the robbery was originally planned\nfor a date in February, 1971. Although the learned\ntrial judge rejected the evidence of Felix Dumeh, it\nis nonetheless still possible to prove the agreement\nor concert between the accused persons to abet the\nrobbery but, apart from the supposed oath taking in\nFebruary, 1971 the 1st accused, Patrick Njovens,\nwho was warned about the presence of the\n58\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n60/66\nprospective robbers in Ibadan preparing for the\nrobbery, intentionally failed to prevent the\ncommission of the robbery. He pretended to arrest\nthe prospective robbers but soon released them on\nbail to the arch-robber Felix Dumeh; he ordered\nthe arrest and unjustified detention of the\npolicemen from Ilorin who had come to Ibadan to\ninvestigate the robbery and indeed attempted to\nterrify the 8th P. W. into removing the policemen\nfrom the Western State completely without\ncompleting their investigation; he, without any\njustification whatsoever, refused to release\nLieutenant Usman, the most dangerous of the\nrobbers and the person who actually shot at the\nvehicle carrying the money on the 13th April, 1971\nto the Kwara police and purported to lock him up in\nthe Ibadan police cell without any records\nwhatsoever of any offence against him at a time\nwhen the Kwara police most seriously were looking\nfor him. In the same way the 2nd accused took part\nin every act or omission of the 1st accused and\nevery time the 1st accused went out on pretended\ntrack of the robbers, the 2nd accused was with him.\n?In the same way, the 3rd accused, Amusa\nAbidogun, although an Alhaji, was all the time and\nat every stage the most loyal, most willing and\nmost ardent supporter of the 1st accused. He\nwilfully and successfully led the 8th P. W. on a wild\ngoose chase for several days whilst pretending to\nhelp him locate the whereabouts of the robbers,\nthus giving the robbers further opportunity of\nperfecting their schemes of escape or\n59\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n61/66\ndisappearance. It is noteworthy that Felix Dumeh\nwas arrested in Akure where he, 3rd accused, had\nbeen transferred from Ibadan soon after the\nrobbery. The 4th accused described himself as a\ntrader and ostensibly completely ignorant of the\nrobbers and their profession but there was\nevidence, accepted by the learned trial judge, that\nhe was seen in the house of Felix Dumeh in\nFebruary 1971, that in the presence of the 8th\nP.W. Felix Dumeh accused him of having promised\nto protect him. There is the statement which he\nmade himself admitting his presence at the\noath-taking ceremony in the house of Felix Dumeh\non the 13th April, 1971 and the inexplicable\nreceipt, proved against him, of the amounts of\n5,000 pounds in that parcel from Felix Dumeh on\nthe night of the 13th April, 1971. It is difficult to\nsee the acts and/or omissions of these men in any\ndifferent light than that of complicity and their acts\nare certainly not explicable on any other rational\ngrounds.\nAll the accused persons are charged with various\ncounts of specific offences comprising of acts or\nomissions which would constitute for each of them\nthe actus reus to associate him with the conspiracy\nfor be it known conspiracies take various forms and\nwhilst a conspiracy may exist in the form of one\nconspirator being like the hub of a bicycle the\nothers rotating around him, another conspiracy\nmay be in the form of a chain in which one\nconspirator hooks on to the other and so on ad\ninfinitum, or indeed a conspiracy may exist in both\n60\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n62/66\nof those forms or in other forms.\nAt the beginning of this appeal, the learned\nDirector of Public Prosecutions informed us that he\nwas not supporting the convictions on the other\ncounts of the charge on which the accused persons\nwere severally convicted, except counts Nos. 1 and\n2. There is only one set of evidence which is being\nused to prove the conspiracy as well as the specific\ncharges. In R. v. Dawson and Ors. [1960] 1 W.L.R.\n163, the Court of Criminal Appeal deprecated this\npractice which carries no legal obloquy whatsoever\nbut fails to stand the test of strategy. See the\nobservations of Finnemore, J. at p. 170 of the\nreport. We think that the learned trial judge was\nright to conclude that all the accused persons took\npart in abetting the offence of robbery committed\non the 13th April, 1971 on the Bacita Road.\nThe count of receiving is simpler. There is\nevidence, which the learned trial judge accepted,\nthat all the accused persons were present in the\nhouse of Felix Dumeh on the night of the robbery\nand collected with their own hand their own share\nof the loots. As stated before, the identity of the\nmoney is not in dispute. The 6th P.W. Lasisi Seidu,\none of those who committed the robbery and\nprocured the money, saw it when Felix Dumeh set\nit aside. The 2nd accused in his statement (exhibit\n7) and the 4th accused in his statements (exhibits\n11 and 12) both confirmed their visit to the house\nof Felix Dumeh on the night of the 13th April, 1971\nand gave a description of the parcel containing the\namount of 5,000 pounds which tallies with the\n61\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n63/66\ndescription of it by the 6th P.W., Lasisi Seidu. As\nfar as they are concerned, the evidence of the self\nconfessed robbers and their apprentices is only\ncorroborative of their own statements and there is\nno evidence stronger than a persons own\nadmissions. With respect to the 1st accused and the\n3rd accused, they denied that they went to the\nhouse of Felix Dumeh on the night of the 13th\nApril, 1971 but the learned trial judge disbelieved\ntheir denials. This was an issue of fact and we think\nthat the evidence is incapable of any other\nreasonable conclusion. If the accused persons did\ngo to the house of Felix Dumeh on the night of the\n13th April, 1971 and jointly received a parcel\ncontaining the particular amount of 5,000 pounds\ncontained in the charge proceeds of the robbery and\nbefore doing so took an oath of secrecy, there is no\nroom for any complaint about the justification of\nthe learned trial judge finding that the 5,000\npounds was part of the loot of the morning, that all\nthe accused persons knew this and that they all\naccepted it as planned and expected. We have no\nhesitation in concluding that the offence of\nreceiving has been proved against all the accused\npersons.\nWe conclude that the charges against the accused\nperson on the 1st and 2nd counts are proved and\nthat all the grounds of appeal argued in their\nfavour have failed. We make the following orders;\n(i) We direct that all the accused persons be\ndischarged and acquitted on the counts other than\ncount 1 and count 2 on which they were severally\n62\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n64/66\nconvicted by the learned trial judge because we\nagree with the Director of Public Prosecutions that\nthose charges cannot stand.\n(ii) In respect of count 1 and count 2, the appeals\nof all the accused persons are dismissed and their\nconvictions and sentences are affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n5/8/25, 10:49 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n65/66\nChief F.R.A.

NDIC (1999) 2 NWLR (Pt. 591) 333; Afribank\nNigeria Plc. v. K..C.G. Nigeria Ltd. (2001) 8 NWLR (Pt. 714) 87.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - LITERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION - Approach of Court in interpreting the clear and unambiguous words of a\nstatute\n\"It is a cardinal principle of interpretation that where in their ordinary meaning the provisions are clear and unambiguous, effect should be given to them as\nsuch. (see for example Awolowo v. Shagari (1979) 6 - 9 SC 51; Nafiu Rabiu v. State (1980) 8 -11 SC 130; Att. Gen. of Bendel State v. Att. Gen. of the Federation\n(1981) 3 NCLR 1 (1981) 10 SC 1.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - \"SUBJECT TO\" - Legal effect to be given to the word \"Subject to\" as used in Section 272 of the 1999 Constitution\n\"In regard to Section 272 of the Constitution, Section 251 of the 1999 Constitution is directly relevant in that the former is made subject to it. The expression\n\"subject to\" means liable, subordinate, subservient, or inferior to, governed or affected by, provided that or provided;' answerable for see Black's Law\nDictionary, 6th Edition, page 1425. It must therefore be understood that 'subject to' introduces a condition, a restriction, a limitation, a proviso: See Oke v.\nOke (1974) 1 All NLR (Pt. 1) 443 at 450. It subordinates the provisions of the subject section to the section empowered by reference thereto and which is\nintended not to be diminished by the subject section. The expression generally implies that what the section is subject to shall govern, control and prevail\nover what follows in that subject section of the enactment, so that it renders the provision to which it is subject to conditional upon compliance with or\nadherence to what is prescribed in the provision referred to see Tukur v. Government of Gongola State (1989) 4 NWLR (Pt. 117) 517 at 542,565,580; ldehen v.\nldehen (1991) 6 NWLR (Pt. 198) 382 at 148; Labiyi v. Anretiola (1992) 8 NWLR (Pt. 258) 139 at 163-164.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - \"NOTWITHSTANDING\" - Meaning of the word \"notwithstanding\" as used in Section 251(1) of the 1999 Constitution\n\"As has been observed, Section 251(1) of the 1999 Constitution begins with \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution\" while\nSection 272(1) of the 1979 Constitution is specifically made \"subject to the provisions of Section 251.\" When the term \"notwithstanding\" is used in a section\nof a statute, it is meant to exclude an impinging or impeding effect of any other provision of the statute or other subordinate legislation so that the said\nsection may fulfill itself. It follows that, as used in Section 251(1) of the 1999 Constitution, no provision of that Constitution shall be capable of undermining\nthe said Section.\"\nJURISDICTION - JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL HIGH COURT - Whether the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in cases of\nbanker/customer relationship\n\"It will be seen clearly that Section 251(1)( d) confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court in specified matters notwithstanding Section 272(1).\nWhat this means is that the jurisdiction conferred upon and exercised by the State High Court hitherto in regard to those specified matters has been\nremoved. The proviso to Section 251(1)(d) however exempts any dispute between an individual customer and his bank from the exclusive jurisdiction of the\nFederal High Court. What this means is this. The proviso has done two things. First, the jurisdiction of the State High Court in transactions involving an\nindividual customer and his bank has been preserved. In the second place, although the Federal High Court has jurisdiction in such disputes, it is not to the\nexclusion of the State High Court. In other words both Courts have concurrent jurisdiction. That is to say that under the proviso to Section 251(1)(d) of the\n1999 Constitution, the Federal High Court has concurrent jurisdiction with State High Court in transactions involving an individual customer and his bank:\nSee Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria v. NDIC (1999) 2 NWLR (Pt. 591) 333.\"\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/145\nCASE LAW - RATIO DECIDENDI/OBITER DICTUM - Whether an appeal is against the ratio decidendi or an obiter dictum\n\"It is undoubtedly settled law, that an appeal is usually against a ratio and not against an obiter except in cases where the obiter is so closely linked with the\nratio as to be deemed to have radically influenced the ratio. But even there, the appeal is against the ratio. See Saude v. Abdullahi (1989) 7 NWLR (Pt. 116)\n387, 431; Ogunbiyi v. Ishola (1996) 6 NWLR (Pt. 452) 12, (1996) 9 SCNJ 143 at 153; Coker v. United Bank for Africa (1997) 2 NWLR (Pt.105 490) 641, (1997) 2\nSCNJ 130, 145.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - \"THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL NOT APPLY\" - Interpretation of the phrase \"this paragraph shall not apply\" as used in\nSection 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution\n\"The phrase \"this paragraph shall not apply\" in the proviso to Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution means what it says, and that is that the exclusive\njurisdiction on matters listed in Sub-Section (1) of S. 251 of the 1999 Constitution, does not apply to disputes between individual customer and his bank. It\ndoes not mean, that the Federal High Court shall have no jurisdiction in the simple customer/bank relationship at all. If that was the intention of the law\nmaker, it would have said so expressly by simply providing that the Federal High Court shall have no jurisdiction to hear and determine any such dispute.\"\nWORDS AND PHRASES - \"BANKING\" - Meaning of \"banking\"\n\"Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition, page 146 as follows: \"The business of banking, as defined by law and custom, consists in the issue of notes payable on\ndemand intended to circulate as money when the banks are banks of issue in receiving deposits payable on demand, in discounting commercial paper,\nmaking loans of money on collateral security, buying and selling bills of exchange, negotiating loans, and dealing in negotiable securities issued by the\ngovernment, state and national, and municipal and other corporations.\"\nJURISDICTION - JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL HIGH COURT - Whether the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in cases of\nbanker/customer relationship\n\"Plainly, the proviso in question in Section 251(1)(d), to put it in simple analysis, says that the Federal High Court will have exclusive jurisdiction in banking\nmatters but when what is involved is individual customer and his bank transaction, the Federal High Court shall not have exclusive jurisdiction.\nUnderstandably, that was to recognise the jurisdiction of the State High Courts had been exercising in such matters which Section 272(1) of the\nConstitution impliedly preserves. The High Court of a State can only exercise jurisdiction in any aspect of such specified matters to the extent that the\nproviso in Section 251(1)(d) permits. The said proviso, cannot be interpreted to have the effect of conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the State High Courts\nand completely taking away the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to entertain causes and matters relating to individual customer and bank\ntransactions...\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - PROVISO - Meaning and purpose of a proviso in a statute\n\"As a general rule, a proviso has a limited operation in qualifying the ambit of the section to which it is related see Llyods &amp; Scottish Finance Ltd. v.\nModern Cars &amp; Caravans (Kingston) Ltd. (1964) 2 ALL ER 732 at 740. It follows that, where a section with a proviso appended to it confers powers, it\nwould be contrary to the ordinary operation of the proviso to give that section an effect which would neutralise those powers in a way that it goes beyond\nwhat compliance with the proviso itself renders necessary. The object of a proviso is normally to cut down or qualify or create exceptions to or relax in a\ndefined sense the limitations imposed or powers conferred by a section of an enactment or document; or to exclude some possible ground of\nmisinterpretation of its extent, or to modify the main part of a section of a statute to which it relates or to restrain its absoluteness or generality. see Re\nTabrisky ex parte Board of Trade (1947) 2 All ER 182 at 183-184 per Lord Greene, M.

The provisions read: \"236(1) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and in\naddition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by law, the High Court of a State shall have unlimited jurisdiction to hear and determine any\ncivil proceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue or to hear and\ndetermine any criminal proceedings involving or relating to any penalty, forfeiture, punishment or other liability in respect of an offence committed by any\nperson.\"\nJURISDICTION - JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL HIGH COURT - Whether the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in cases of\nbanker/customer relationship\n\"It can be seen that Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution was meant to give the Federal High Court exclusive jurisdiction in \"banking\" in the wide sense\nto involve all banking transactions see the definition given in the Black's Law Dictionary (supra). That conclusion cannot be resisted in view of the open\nended text of that provision. But having contemplated conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court in all the items stipulated in paragraph (d),\nwhich by the language used was indeed conferred, the law giver then introduced a proviso thus: \"Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any dispute\nbetween an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer and the bank.\" In considering the effect of the\nproviso in question, the import of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the Federal High Court under Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution should not\nbe lost sight of. The Section begins with, \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution ...\" This takes account of the jurisdiction\nof the High Court of a State in Section 272(1) of the 1999 Constitution which says, \"Subject to the provisions of Section 251 and other provisions of the\nConstitution, the High Court of a State shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil proceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right,\npower, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue. This is not a provision conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the State High Courts.\nSection 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court in specified matters notwithstanding Section 272(1) of the\n1979 Constitution.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - SECTIONS 251(1)(D) AND 272(1) OF THE 1999 CONSTITUTION - Interpretation of Sections 251(1)(d) and 272(1) of the\n1999 Constitution as regards the jurisdiction of the Federal and State High Court\n\"The starting point is Section 272(1) of the 1999 Constitution which confers jurisdiction on the State High Courts. It provides as follows: \"272(1) Subject to\nthe provisions of Section 251 and other provisions of the Constitution, the High Court of a State shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil\nproceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue or to hear and determine\nany criminal proceeding involving or relating to any penalty, forfeiture, punishment or other liability in respect of an offence committed by any person.\" So\nwhat does Section 251 provide? It states thus: 251(1). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this constitution and in addition to such other\njurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an act of the National Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of\nany other Court in civil causes and matters (a.) ...(omitted) (b.) ...(omitted) (c.) ...(omitted) (d.) connected with or pertaining to banking, banks, other financial\ninstitutions, including any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the Central Bank of Nigeria arising from banking, foreign exchange,\ncoinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letters of credit, promissory notes and other fiscal measures: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any\ndispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer and the bank.\"(Italics is mine) There are\ntwo things that I would like to observe from the above quoted provision of Section 272. The first is that whatever jurisdiction is vested in the State High\nCourt by Section 272 of the 1999 Constitution is made subject to the jurisdiction vested in the Federal High Court by or pursuant to Section 251 of the 1999\nConstitution. The second thing to note is the absence of the adjective \"exclusive.\" Thus, it is necessary to bear in mind the provisions of Section 251 of the\n1999 Constitution in construing the jurisdiction vested in the State High Court. In other words, Section 251 of the Constitution which confers jurisdiction on\nthe Federal High Court restricts, limits, governs and indeed prevails over Section 272 of the Constitution which confers jurisdiction on the State High Court.\"\nWORDS AND PHRASES - \"CUSTOMER\" - Definition of \"customer\"\n\"Who is a customer of a bank, Black's Law Dictionary defines the term in relation to banking as any person having an account with a bank or for whom a\nbank has agreed to collect items and includes a bank carrying an account with another bank.\"\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n5/145\nJUDGEMENT SUMMARY\nINTRODUCTION:\nThis appeal borders on the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court.\nFACTS:\nThis is an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal Lagos Division.\nThe 1st respondent, who was a customer of the now defunct Allied Bank of Nigeria Plc., had with the said bank several accounts and was the beneficiary of credit\nfacilities and or loans from the bank. By the 31st of January, 1979 the 1st respondent was indebted to the bank in the sum of N284,108,459.49. Following the revocation\nof the licence by the Central Bank, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation the appellant, was appointed as the liquidator of the bank. Pursuant to the appointment,\nthe appellant then filed an application for the recovery of the debt against the respondents under the provisions of the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial\nMalpractices Decree No. 18 of 1994. And by Decree No. 62 of 1999, Decree No. 18 of 1994 was amended, by substituting the Federal High Court for the tribunal. The suit\nwas therefore accordingly, taken before the Federal High Court.\nAt the commencement of the hearing in that Court, the respondents filed a notice of objection to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to hear the suit and sought\nto have the suit struck out. \u00a0In a short but well considered ruling the trial Court came to the conclusion that in cases and matters between a bank and its individual\ncustomer, the Federal High Court and the State High Courts have concurrent jurisdiction. The learned trial Judge overruled the objection.\u00a0An appeal was lodged by the\ndefendants against that decision to the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. It held that the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction\nto entertain causes and matters relating to individual customer and bank relationship.\u00a0Dissatisfied, the appellant appealed to the Supreme Court.\nISSUES:\nThe Appellant and Respondent distilled four issues each. However\u00a0the Supreme Court determined the appeal on the issue of\u00a0whether the Court of Appeal was right in\nits interpretation of the proviso to\u00a0Section 251 (1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution\u00a0and the effect to be given to\u00a0Decree No. 18 of 1994\u00a0as amended by\u00a0Decree No. 62 of\n1999\u00a0in reaching the conclusion that the State High Courts have exclusive jurisdiction in disputes between an individual customer and his bank.\nDECISION/HELD:\nThe Supreme Court found that there was merit in the appeal and allowed it.\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeal was therefore set aside while the ruling delivered by\nthe Federal High Court which assumes jurisdiction to entertain the suit was restored. N6,000.00 was awarded as costs in the Court of Appeal \u00a0and N10,000.00 as costs\nin the Supreme Court in favour of the plaintiff/appellant.\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n6/145\nSAMSON ODEMWINGIE UWAIFO, J.S.C.: (Delivering the Leading Judgment): The Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (the NDIC) is the liquidator of Allied Bank of\nNigeria, Plc. It acts in that capacity in furtherance of its duties under Section 28 of the Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (the Act) (Cap. 301) Laws of the\nFederation of Nigeria, 1990 and under other laws, and as may be relevant under the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 1990 (the CAMA). The 1st respondent, Okem\nEnterprises Nigeria Limited, was said to be a valued customer of the said Allied Bank of Nigeria Plc. (the bank). It maintained various accounts with different branches of\nthe bank.\nThe 1st respondent obtained credit facilities or loans from the bank. It is alleged that as at 31st January, 1999, the total amount outstanding against the 1st respondent\nwas N284,109,459.59. The bank's licence has been revoked by the Central Bank of Nigeria and this led to the NDIC being appointed the liquidator of the bank.\nThe NDIC filed an application for the recovery of debt in the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Tribunal (the tribunal) Lagos\n1\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n7/145\nZone, on 29th March, 1999 against the 1st respondent and the 2nd - 6th respondents who, at all times material to the action, were the directors of the 1st respondent.\nThis was done by virtue of the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Decree No. 18 of 1994, (Decree No. 18 of 1994). That Decree\nwas amended by Decree No. 62 of 1999, substituting the Federal High Court for the tribunal. This suit was accordingly taken over by the Federal High Court, Lagos after\nthe inception of the present democratic dispensation, trial by tribunal having been discontinued.\nOn 16th April, 2000 the respondents filed a notice of objection to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to entertain the suit, and sought to have the suit struck out.\nThere were four grounds relied on for the objection, namely, that:\n1. The proviso to Section 251(1)(d) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 repeats the terms of Section 230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution (as\namended by Decree No 107 of 1993) and did not vest in the Federal High Court the jurisdiction to determine causes and matters relating to transactions between an\nindividual\n2\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/145\ncustomer and his bank.\n2. The reliefs sought in this suit are matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State High Court.\n3. All claims made or intended to be made by the plaintiff are a nullity since they are all claims and matters over which the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction.\n4. Accordingly, the Federal High Court is devoid of jurisdiction to entertain this suit and the same should therefore be struck out.\nIn a short but well considered ruling given on 18th December, 2000, Abutu, J. came to the conclusion that in causes and matters between a bank and its individual\ncustomer, the Federal High Court and the State High Courts have concurrent jurisdiction. The learned trial Judge overruled the objection.\nAn appeal was lodged by the defendants against that decision to the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division. Two issues were raised before that Court for determination,\nnamely:\n\"i) Whether the learned trial Judge was right in holding, that the present state of the law is that the Federal High Court has concurrent jurisdiction with State High\nCourts to entertain disputes between banks and their individual customers and\n3\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/145\nthereby assumed jurisdiction to entertain the suit herein.\n(ii) Whether the learned trial Judge was correct in the decision that the Federal High Court is vested with jurisdiction to entertain the suit by virtue of the provisions of\nthe Failed Banks\u00a0Decree as amended by the Tribunals (Certain Consequential Amendments etc) Decree No. 62 of 1999.\"\nThe Court of Appeal on 4th February, 2003, allowed the appeal. It held that the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain causes and matters about individual\ncustomer and bank relationship.\nThis is an appeal against that decision. The appellant has set, down four issues for determination as follows:\n\"1. Whether the Court below was right when it restricted itself to the provisions of Decree No 107 of 1993 and Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution in considering\nwhether the position of the law as regards the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and State High Court in respect of transaction between individual customers and\ntheir bank had been altered since the time of the 1979 Constitution.\n2.

This, in fact, involved a reference to\n7\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/145\nSection 7(1) of the Federal Revenue Court Decree, 1973 (later to be known as the Federal High Court Act) whose provisions read thus:\n\"7(1) The Federal Revenue Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction in civil causes and matters -\n(a) relating to the revenue of the government of the Federation in which the said government or any organ thereof or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the said\ngovernment is a party;\n(b) connected with or pertaining to -\n(i) the taxation of companies and of other bodies established or carrying on business in Nigeria and all other persons subject to Federal taxation,\n(ii) customs and excise duties,\n(iii) banking, foreign exchange, currency or other fiscal measures;\n(c) arising from -\n(i) the operation of the Companies Decree, 1968 or any other enactment regulating the operation of companies incorporated under the Companies Decree, 1968.\n(ii) any enactment relating to copyright, patents, designs, trademarks and merchandise marks;\n(iii) any enactment relating to copyright, patents, designs, trademarks and merchandise marks;\n(d) of\n8\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n14/145\nadmiralty jurisdiction.\"\nAfter reproducing the above provisions, the Court below cited the decision of this Court in Jammal Steel Structures Ltd. v. African Continental Bank Ltd. (1973) 1 ALL NLR\n(Pt. 2) 208, and quoted a passage therefrom at page 220; (1973) ANLR (Green Cover) 852 at 862-863. Other passages were quoted from the said Jammal case and\nfrom Bronik Motors Ltd. v. Wema Bank Ltd. (1983) 1 SCNLR 296. The Court then, per Oguntade, JCA, observed as follows:\n\"The Supreme Court held that the Federal High Court has limited jurisdiction in the sense that it has only so much of the jurisdiction conferred expressly by 'existing\nlaws' which are Acts of National Assembly under Section 230 Sub-Section (2) and also under specific Section of the 1979 Constitution as well as such other\njurisdiction as may be conferred on it by future enactments of the National Assembly under Section 230 of the 1979 Constitution.It is note-worthy that the case of\nBronik Motors Ltd. (supra) was considered on the basis of the 1979 Constitution and the jurisdiction conferred thereunder on the Federal\n9\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/145\nHigh Court. Under Section 230(1) of the 1979 Constitution, the jurisdiction of the Federal Revenue Court as granted under the Federal Revenue Court Decree, 1973\nwas preserved; and the Federal Revenue Court was re-christened as Federal High Court.\nNow the 1979 Constitution in relation to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court was amended by Decree No. 107 of 1993. Section 230(1)(d) of Decree No. 107 of\n1993 is in ipssissma (sic) verba with Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution reproduced above. It is correct to say that prior to the coming into force of Decree\nNo. 107 of 1993, the position was that the Federal High Court had a limited jurisdiction and the State High Court an unlimited jurisdiction. It is also the position that civil\ncauses and matters arising from any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transaction between the individual customer and the bank\nwere under the jurisdiction of the State High Court. The question that then arises is- Have Decree No. 107 of 1993 and Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution\naltered the position with regard to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and State High\n10\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/145\nCourt in such matters?\"\nThe learned Justice of Appeal discussed other more recent cases, particularly of the Court of Appeal [some of which I shall consider in the course of this judgment]\nand said inter alia as follows:\n\"It is my view that the Federal High Court only has exclusive jurisdiction in matters specifically stated under the paragraph in Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0before the proviso. To\nhave stated that the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in the areas listed in Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0 cannot without more mean that it has a concurrent\njurisdiction in the area stated under the proviso.\"\nHe went further to state at a later stage of the judgment:\n\"It seems to me that in so far as jurisdiction in dispute between an individual customer and his bank has been vested in State High Courts, Sections 3(1) and 9 of the\nFailed Banks Decree (as amended) which vests jurisdiction on the same matters in the Federal High Court must be seen as inconsistent with Section 251 (1)(d) of the\n1999 Constitution. In that case, Section 1(3) of the 1999 Constitution makes it void to the extent of the inconsistency.\"\nReference was made by\n11\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/145\nOguntade, JCA to the decision of the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division in N.D.I.C. v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (1997) 2 NWLR (Pt. 490) 735 which had considered\nSection 230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution as amended by Decree No. 107 of 1993 and pronounced that it gave the Federal High Court and State High Courts\nconcurrent jurisdiction. But he came to the conclusion that that pronouncement was obiter because, in his understanding, the issues before the Court did not call for a\ndetermination whether or not the Federal High Court and the State High Courts have concurrent jurisdiction in disputes between an individual customer and his bank.\nHe set out the said issues. He referred to two other decisions of the Court of Appeal where a contrary view was expressed, and said:\n\"As was held by the Court of Appeal in the two cases, I hold the view that in the dispute between an individual customer and his bank, only a State High Court has\njurisdiction.\nIn holding this view, I bear in mind that before the promulgation of Decree No. 107 of 1993, the Federal High Court did not have jurisdiction in such matters. It seems to\nme that if it was the\n12\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/145\nintention of the draftsman in (Decree No. 107 of 1993) to grant the Federal High Court a jurisdiction which it did not previously enjoy, it would have done so in clear,\ndirect and explicit language. It is my view, that the Federal High Court only has exclusive jurisdiction in matters specifically stated under the paragraph in Section\n230(1)(d)\u00a0before the proviso. To have stated that the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in the areas listed in Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0cannot without more mean\nthat it has a concurrent jurisdiction in the area stated under the proviso.\"\nAlthough the learned trial Justice proceeded to say:\n\"Appellant's counsel has submitted that enactments conferring (exclusive) jurisdiction on the Federal High Court are existing laws which must be brought in conformity\nwith the 1999 Constitution pursuant to Section 315 of the 1999 Constitution. I entirely agree with him,\" yet he reached the final conclusion to allow the appeal without\nconceding any right of jurisdiction to the Federal High Court to hear disputes between individual customer and his bank.\n13\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/145\nWith due respect to the learned Justice of Appeal, I have to say that he fell into fundamental misconceptions, namely, about\n(1) the proper import of the decisions in Jammal case and Bronik case which he discussed and relied on;\n(2) the correct interpretation of Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution which he attempted, having regard to the essential function of a proviso in an enactment;\nand (3) the effect of Sections 1(3) and 315 of the 1999 Constitution on Sections 3(1) and 9 of the Failed Banks Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended by Decree No. 62\nof 1999 in regard to the resolution of the issue of inconsistency. I think a combination of these vital matters was responsible for the grave error committed by the Court\nbelow in reversing the decision of the Federal High Court per Abutu, J.\nIt is important to understand what Jammal case decided, why it was so decided and what arguments led to it. Before the Federal Revenue Court Decree No. 13 of\n1973 which established the Federal Revenue Court was enacted, State High Courts had jurisdiction (and I shall explain presently what circumstances directly\n14\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/145\npermitted that jurisdiction) over \"banking\" matters and other matters like admiralty, customs and excise duties, exchange and currency, taxation of companies etc. The\noperative Constitution then was the 1963 Constitution of the Federation. In particular, Section 78(1) thereof gave Parliament the sole power to make laws for banks and\nbanking as follows:\n\"78(1) Parliament may make laws for Nigeria or any part thereof with respect to banks and banking.\"\nHowever, Sub-section (2) of Section 78 made provision thus\n\"(2) Nothing in this Section shall preclude the legislature of a State from establishing an authority for the 'purpose of carrying on (subject to and in compliance with any\nAct of Parliament for the time being in force and in particular any act relating to banks and banking) the business of banking in Nigeria or elsewhere or from making\nsuch provision for the constitution of that authority and regulating the performance by that authority of its functions as is consistent with any Act of Parliament.\"\nOrdinarily in a federal system of government, Federal Courts would adjudicate over matters in which the Central Parliament has\n15\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n21/145\nexclusive legislative competence. But because there were no Federal Courts before Decree No. 13 of 1973 to adjudicate in matters (of banks and banking etc) which\nwere within the exclusive legislative competence of the Parliament, the High Courts of the then regions were given authority which enabled them to adjudicate in\nrespect of matters within the exclusive legislative competence of the Parliament by virtue of Section 3 of the Regional Courts (Federal Jurisdiction) Act (formerly\nOrdinance) (Cap. 177) Vol. V, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria and Lagos, 1958 which provided as follows:\n\"Where by the law of a region, jurisdiction is conferred upon a High Court or a Magistrate's Court for the hearing and determination of civil causes relating to matters\nwith respect to which the legislature of the region may make laws, and of appeals arising out of such causes, the Court shall, except in so far as other provision is made\nby any law in force in the region, have the like jurisdiction with respect to the hearing and determination of civil causes relating to matters within the exclusive\nlegislative competence of the Federal Legislature, and of appeals arising\n16\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/145\nout of such causes.\"\nThose were the circumstances, I earlier hinted in which Regional High Courts were given jurisdiction [by the said ordinance] to adjudicate in matters of banks and\nbanking etc which, had there been Federal Courts, such ordinance would have been most probably unwarranted.\nOn the promulgation of Decree No. 13 of 1973, Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the said Decree, which is germane to the present case, gave or \"transferred\" jurisdiction to the\nFederal Revenue Court in civil causes and matters connected with or pertaining to -\n\"banking, foreign exchange, currency or other fiscal measures.\"\nWhat really happened by the intervention of Decree No. 13 of 1973 was that the jurisdiction permitted to Regional High Courts relating to some of the matters within\nthe exclusive legislative competence of the Federal Legislature was withdrawn and exclusive jurisdiction in those matters was then conferred on the Federal Revenue\nCourt.\nThose matters included the ones just enumerated above as contained in the provision of Section 7(1)(b)(iii). But it is essential to note, because it is of great relevance,\nhow the above provision is\n17\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/145\nworded. It is also pertinent to consider the effect of what Section 63(4) of the said Decree, [now Section 64(4) of the Federal High Court Act, (Cap. 134) Laws of\nthe Federation of Nigeria, 1990] provided that for the avoidance of doubt, the Regional Courts (Federal Jurisdiction) Act inter alia shall be construed with such\nmodifications as may be necessary to bring it into conformity with the provisions of the Decree. The said decree was thus the dominant statute with which the\nRegional Courts (Federal Jurisdiction) Act must be consistent through modifications as may be necessary in interpretation. This would seem to be of some moment as\nto what extent the Regional (or State) High Courts would be accommodated to adjudicate in respect of matters, the said decree had \"transferred\" jurisdiction to the\nFederal Revenue Court. The relevant matter of jurisdiction as it relates to the present case is \"banking.\" One may ask, which aspect of banking had then been given to\nthe Federal Revenue Court exclusively from the wording of Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree? Is it \"banking\" in the broad sense or \"banking\" in its limited interpretation\nwhich became an issue in\n18\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/145\nJammal\u00a0case?\nIn the Jammal\u00a0case, questions of real concern arose. The Federal Revenue Court had recently been conferred with jurisdiction in banking, a matter within the exclusive\nlegislative competence of the federal legislature. The jurisdiction of the State High Courts in that same subject of banking, as I have said, had been directly derived from\nthe Regional Courts (Federal Jurisdiction) Act. It was that same Act [and other specified enactments, e.g. Admiralty Jurisdiction Act, 1962] which allowed Regional\n(State) High Courts to have jurisdiction over other Federal matters relating to revenue, taxation of companies, customs and excise, foreign exchange, currency,\ncopyright, patents, designs, trademarks, admiralty etc. That was when there was no Federal Court to adjudicate over those matters. Now, Decree No. 13 of 1973\ntransferred to, and conferred exclusive jurisdiction on, the Federal Revenue Court in respect of those matters; and Section 63(4) of the said Decree would not permit\nState High Courts to exercise jurisdiction in respect of matters over which jurisdiction was now conferred on the Federal Revenue Court unless to\n19\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/145\nthe extent that the Regional Courts (Federal Jurisdiction) Act was construed with necessary modifications to bring it in line with the Decree.\nThe question then arose whether there was still jurisdiction in the State High Courts in banking matters. This question had to be resolved in a suit then pending in the\nHigh Court of Lagos State, for \"the balance due to the plaintiffs for an over-draft granted by the plaintiffs to the defendants at their Idumota Branch, Lagos, in the\nnormal course of their business as bankers to the defendants and for money paid by the plaintiffs to the defendants as bankers at the latter's request, which said sum\nthe defendants have refused and/or neglected to pay in spite of repeated demands.\" That was the case of the African Continental Bank Limited, as plaintiffs, against\nJammal Steel Structures Limited, as defendants. It was a case of an individual customer and its bank relationship over an alleged debt owing from banking transactions\nwhich eventually got to the Supreme Court as the Jammal's case (supra).\nChief Williams appeared for the defendants/appellants while Mr. Evan Enwerem appeared for the\n20\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/145\nplaintiffs/respondents. Dr. N. B. Graham-Douglas, the Attorney-General of the Federation appeared as amicus curiae. Chief Williams' submission, in short, was that\nsince the action was filed after the Federal Revenue Court had assumed jurisdiction in banking matters and had started to work, the High Court of Lagos State no\nlonger had any jurisdiction. Mr. Enwerem submitted that \"banking\" in the context in which it was used in Section 7(1)(b )(iii) of the Decree could only be in reference to\na transaction in which the Federal Government was interested and not a simple contractual relationship such as that between banker and customer. Dr. Graham-\nDouglas had also submitted in line with Chief Williams' contention that \"all banking transactions\" were included within Section 7(1)(b)(iii)\u00a0of the Decree with the result\nthat the Lagos State High Court had ceased to have jurisdiction in the case brought against Jammal by the African Continental Bank.\nNow, the interpretation whether Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree conferred exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal Revenue Court in all banking matters depended on\nthe controlling effect of\n21\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/145\n\"or other fiscal measures\" on the word \"banking\" in the said Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree.\nThis Court adopted the ejusdem generis rule of interpretation to reach the conclusion that the Section placed a limited meaning on \"banking\" so that what it really\nconnotes is \"banking measures.\" Banking measures were considered by this Court in Jammal case to be policy matters of the Federal Government. That meant that it\nwas only in respect of banking measures that the interest of the Federal Government would be affected and, therefore, the Federal Revenue Court would have exclusive\njurisdiction only in causes or matters concerning banking measures. In the majority decision of this Court delivered by Elias CJN, he observed inter alia at [(1973) 1 ALL\nN.L.R\u00a0(Pt.2); (1973) ANLR (Green Cover)] page 219; and pages 861-862 respectively that:\n\"After a very careful consideration of all arguments put before us, we think that the ejusdem generis rule applies to the interpretation of Section 7(1)(b )(iii) with the\nresult that the word 'measures' must be taken to qualify each of the preceding specifically enumerated subjects, including 'banking'. This means that\n22\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/145\nthe natural and ordinary meaning to be given to the Sub-section' is that it should be as 'banking measures, foreign exchange measures, currency measures or other\nfiscal measures' .\"\nAnd then, at pages 220-222 and pages 862-864 respectively, the learned Chief Justice observed further, and I shall quote him in extenso as follows inter alia:\n\"We are accordingly of the opinion that in Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree, the word 'other measures' must be construed ejusdem generis with the words 'banking',\n'foreign exchange', and 'currency'. Thus construed, banking measures would cover such pieces of legislation, orders and regulations of the Federal Government as relate\nto banking for example, the Banking Decree 1969, Central Bank of Nigeria Act (Cap. 30 of 1958 Edition), and ancillary enactments.\nWhere any dispute relates to breach of or non-compliance with certain formalities required by law for the lawful operations of banking business, it is a matter for the\nFederal Revenue Court because it involves a government measure and the government is a necessary party. Thus in Merchants Bank\n23\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n29/145\nLtd. v. Federal Minister of Finance (1961) ALL NLR 598 the question at issue was the revocation of the licence of the plaintiff bank by the defendant under the Banking\nAct, 1958 Edition. Such a case must go to the Federal Revenue Court. But where there is involved only a dispute between a bank and one or more of its customers in the\nordinary course of banking business or transaction, as is the case with the subject matter of the present case, because the government is not really interested in the\noutcome of the dispute, apart of course from its interest in the general maintenance of law and order. (sic) ...\nIt was argued by the learned Attorney-General that the inclusion of Sub-Section (d) in Section 7(1) of the Decree in respect of admiralty case is an indication that the\nFederal Revenue Court was intended to have jurisdiction in other cases than revenue matters. This may be so, but we observe that the original jurisdiction in admiralty\ncases in respect of which the Supreme Court formerly had a monopoly was taken away from it and expressly given to the High Courts of the States by the Admiralty\nJurisdiction Act, 1962, which is also referred to in\n24\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n30/145\nSection 63(4) of the Federal Revenue Court Decree, 1973. This last provision seems to say that, for the avoidance of doubt, the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act, 1962 'shall\nbe construed with such modifications as may be necessary to bring it into conformity with the provisions of the Federal Revenue Court Decree. We do not understand\nthis to mean that the Admiralty Jurisdiction Act, 1962 is thereby repealed, leaving jurisdiction in admiralty cases only to the Federal Revenue Court. It seems to us that\nonly such causes or matters of admiralty as pertain to Federal Government vessel or property or revenue are within the jurisdiction of the Federal Revenue Court. If the\ntrue intention had been to take all admiralty jurisdiction out of the hand of all State High Courts, express provision would have been made for such a contingency in the\nFederal Revenue Court Decree ...\nWe also think that another reason for giving Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree, the construction we have adopted above is that the true object and purpose of the\nFederal Revenue Court Decree, as can be gathered from the four corners of it, is the more expeditious despatch of revenue cases\n25\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/145\nparticularly those relating to personal income tax, company tax, customs and excise duties, illegal currency deals, exchange control measures and the like, which the\nState High Courts were supposed to have been too tardy to dispose of especially in recent years. It does not seem to us that the legislative intention behind the\nDecree was to clutter up the new Revenue Court with ordinary cases involving banker-customer relationship, such as disputes in respect of an over-draft, or the\nnegligent dishonouring of a customer's cheques - all 'banking transactions' having nothing to do with Federal Revenue concern. All the State High Courts and other\nappropriate Courts must continue to exercise their jurisdiction in these and similar matters if the Federal Revenue Court must be allowed to concentrate on its\nessential revenue protection functions. In any case, we would require a clearer and more definitive provision than that in Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree before we\nshould be disposed to assent to the submission of both Chief Williams for the appellants and the learned Attorney-General that jurisdiction in 'all banking matters'\nthroughout the Federation and\n26\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/145\nwhatever their nature has in fact been exclusively vested in the Federal Revenue Court.\"\nIt can be easily seen that the interpretation of \"banking\" in Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree to mean \"banking measures\" denied it of the wide meaning of \"banking\" in\nits ordinary sense, as given in Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition, page 146 as follows:\n\"The business of banking, as defined by law and custom, consists in the issue of notes payable on demand intended to circulate as money when the banks are banks of\nissue in receiving deposits payable on demand, in discounting commercial paper, making loans of money on collateral security, buying and selling bills of\nexchange, negotiating loans, and dealing in negotiable securities issued by the government, state and national, and municipal and other corporations.\"\n(Italics mine)\nThe implication of appreciating the meaning of the word \"banking\" in the ordinary sense, without its being restricted as a fiscal measure of the Federal Government by\nthe ejusdem generis rule of interpretation as done by the majority decision in regard to Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree, can be noted in the minority\n27\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n33/145\nview expressed by Fatayi-Williams, JSC (later CJN). I find myself referring to his minority view merely to elicit the ordinary meaning of \"banking\".\nThe learned trial Justice observed at pages 237-238 and page 877 respectively:\n\" ... would interpret 'banking' in its ordinary sense and hold that the expression is wide enough to embrace every transaction coming within the legitimate business of a\nbanker. The nature of the claim in the case in hand shows clearly that the transaction which formed the basis of it is that of banking. The learned trial Judge is also of\nthe same view. It will be recalled that in the course of his judgment he said that he had 'no difficulty whatsoever in coming to the view that the transaction in the case\nwas a banking transaction.' As all that, we are concerned with is the meaning of the word 'banking' and as I have formed the view that the word stands alone, I am also\nof the view that the ejusdem generis rule does not apply.\"\nThe learned trial Justice was of the view that the word \"banking\" stood uncontrolled by the phrase \"fiscal measures\" and upon that wide meaning, held that the Federal\nRevenue Court had exclusive\n28\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n34/145\njurisdiction over banking in its broad meaning. It is no surprise that that view of Fatayi-Williams, JSC contrasts with the conclusion reached by the majority at page 224\nand page 866 respectively thus:\n\"In the view we have taken, of Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree that only 'banking measures' are contemplated therein and not 'all banking transactions' whatsoever, we\nhold that the subject matter of this appeal, which is a simple dispute between banker and customer in respect of an overdraft account, is within the jurisdiction of the\nHigh Court of Lagos State, and not the Federal Revenue Court.\"\nThe majority decision in Jammal case was approved in Bronik Motors Ltd. v. Wema Bank Ltd. (1983) 1 SCNLR 296, where it was discussed at length in regard to the\napplicability of the ejusdem generis rule. Bronik case was decided after the Federal Revenue Court had been changed to the Federal High Court. Just as in the majority\ndecision in Jammal case, where Elias, CJN made some relevant remarks, Nnamani, JSC who gave the leading judgment in Bronik case said at page 316:\n\"Having held that the majority judgment is right in construing\n29\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n35/145\nSection\u00a07(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree, such that the Federal Revenue Court is restricted to its essentially revenue protection functions while the State High Courts deal\nwith such matters in which no issue of the revenue of the government of the federation arises, I would agree that there has to be express provision and a more\ndefinitive provision than Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree before one can accept the contention that 'all banking matters' must fall within the jurisdiction of the Federal\nHigh Court.\"\nIt is plain to me, that the Court below missed the essence of the judgment of this Court in the Jammal case. The ratio decidendi of it was the result of the canon of\ninterpretation adopted in respect of Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree. It construed \"banking\" as meaning \"banking measures\" by the application of the ejusdem\ngeneris rule. This was a restricted meaning bringing it within the federal government fiscal measures on banking, a pure concept of the federal government revenue\npolicy considered in Jammal and Bronik to be in line with the Federal Revenue Court objective. While it gave exclusive jurisdiction in such fiscal measures to the Federal\nRevenue Court, the interpretation\n30\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n36/145\nexcluded banker and individual customer relationship. Matters and causes concerning that remained under the jurisdiction of State High Courts.\nNow, it is well to recall that when the Federal Revenue Court Decree, 1973 was enacted, the relevant provision of the 1963 Constitution of the Federation on banking\nwas Section 78(1) which provided that parliament may make laws for Nigeria or any part thereof with respect to banks and banking. By virtue of Items 44 and 45 of\nthe exclusive legislative list in the Second Schedule to the 1979 Constitution of the Federation and Part III of the said Schedule, the federal government had\nauthority to provide for \"the jurisdiction, powers, practice and procedure of Courts of law\" established to carry out the provisions of any enactment passed by virtue of\nthat authority.\nThe Federal Revenue Court Decree, 1973 was enacted, in virtue of the relevant Laws and, of course, by the overriding authority of the Federal Military Government.\nHowever, even under Section 230 of the 1979 Constitution before it was amended, the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court was simply thus:\n\"230.(1) Subject to the provisions of this\n31\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n37/145\nConstitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an act of the National Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have jurisdiction\n(a) in such matters connected with or pertaining to the revenue of the government of the federation as may be prescribed by the National Assembly; and\n(b) in such other matters as may be prescribed as respects which the National Assembly has power to make laws.\n(2) Notwithstanding Sub-section (1) of this Section, where by law any Court established before the date when this Section comes into force is empowered to exercise\njurisdiction for the hearing and determination of any of the matters to which Sub-section (1) of this Section relates, such Court shall as from the date when this\nSection comes into force be restyled 'Federal High Court', and shall continue to have all the powers and exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by any law.\"\nSection 7(1)(b)(iii) of Decree No. 13 of 1973 as interpreted and Section 230(1)(a) of the 1979 Constitution as it then stood, admittedly, restricted the jurisdiction of\nthe Federal High Court. Mr. Clarke, learned counsel for\n32\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n38/145\nthe respondents, referring to Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree, and upon his own understanding of the Jammal case, has argued in his brief of argument that:\n\"Under the above provision, jurisdiction in civil causes and matters connected with or pertaining to banking was vested in the Federal High Court. Despite the fact that\nthe provision did not expressly exclude disputes between an individual customer and his bank, this Honourable Court still held that it was not the legislative intent\nto vest the Federal High Court with jurisdiction in such matters. This was in Jammal Steel Structures Ltd. v. ACB (1973) 1 ALL NLR (Pt. 11) 208.\"\n(Italics mine)\nThe fatal flaw in this submission, as evident from the italicized portion, has been spotlighted in what I pointed out to be the ratio decidendi of Jammal's case. Mr.\nClarke either overlooked or misconceived the critical role played in the application of the ejusdem generis rule in Jammal case.\nI need to draw attention here to Section 236(1) of the 1979 Constitution. The provisions read:\n\"236(1) Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and in addition to such other\n33\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n39/145\njurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by law, the High Court of a State shall have unlimited jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil proceedings in which the\nexistence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue or to hear and determine any criminal proceedings involving or\nrelating to any penalty, forfeiture, punishment or other liability in respect of an offence committed by any person.\"\nThese provisions were considered both in Bronik case and Savannah Bank of Nigeria Ltd. v. Pan Atlantic Shipping & Transport Agencies Ltd. (1987) 1 NWLR (Pt. 49) 212;\n(1987) 18 NSCC (Pt. 1) 67. Obviously, the said provisions made no distinction between matters within federal legislative competence and states legislative competence.\nBut the decision in the Savannah Bank case in the interpretation of Section 236(1) of the 1979 Constitution, as it tended to allow State High Courts to make an inroad\ninto the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court, became quite controversial.\nChief Clarke has argued on behalf of the respondents in reliance on the Savannah Bank case that this Court \"held that Section\n34\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n40/145\n8(1) of the Federal High Court Act, 1973 which gave the Court exclusive jurisdiction in admiralty matters was inconsistent with Section 236 of the 1979 Constitution\nunder which the State High Court was vested with unlimited jurisdiction and was therefore void to the extent of its inconsistency with the constitution.\" That may well\nbe so. But I think, with due respect, Chief Clarke would seem to fail to take cognisance of the fact that Section 236 of the 1979 Constitution has now been replaced by\nSection 272(1) of the 1999 Constitution with the word \"unlimited\" dropped from \"jurisdiction\" and the said Section 272(1)\u00a0is made subject to Section 251. Section\n251\u00a0was meant to put an end to the controversy generated by the Savannah Bank case. This has created a lot of difference in the legal situation, rendering Chief\nClarke's said submission completely off the point and therefore untenable. I think Alhaji Ibrahim, SAN, on behalf of the appellant, made a significant point both in his\nbrief and in his oral argument before this Court. He said that from the various provisions of the law, more recently conferring jurisdiction on the Federal High Court, that\nCourt has\n35\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n41/145\nvirtually gone beyond the original intention of making it just a revenue Court; and that the decisions in Jammal case, Bronik case and Savannah Bank Case have to that\nextent spent their force. I am in complete agreement with that submission.\nBy the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree No. 107 of 1993 (the Decree no. 107 of 1993), Section 230 of the 1979 Constitution was amended to\nconfer on the Federal High Court jurisdiction to hear and determine civil causes and matters arising from a long list of items. The jurisdiction was far beyond what was\ncontemplated under the Federal Revenue Court Act, 1973. I am particular about Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0[in pari materia with Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution]\nwhich is relevant to this case. It provided as follows:\n\"230(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an act of the\nNational Assembly or a Decree, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters arising from -\n(e) banking, banks, other financial\n36\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n42/145\ninstitutions including any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the Central Bank of Nigeria arising from banking, foreign exchange, coinage,\nlegal tender, bills of exchange, letter of credit, promissory note and other fiscal measures:\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to any dispute between an individual, customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer\nand the bank.\"\nNotable in this provision, is the absence of any phrase which will necessitate the application of the ejusdem generis rule that prevailed in Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of\nDecree No. 13 of 1973 when it was interpreted in the Jammal case. Exclusive jurisdiction has been given to the Federal High Court in all the items mentioned therein,\nincluding \"banking\" in its wide sense as must now be recognised since it is not limited to \"banking measures\". Attention must, therefore, be drawn now to the effect\nwhich the proviso has on that exclusive jurisdiction in regard to banking in order that it would receive appropriate consideration. This is so because in the absence of\nthat proviso, the jurisdiction of the State\n37\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n43/145\nHigh Courts would be completely removed.\nThe said provision in Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0together with the proviso has been interpreted in some decisions of the Court of Appeal. It would appear that two conflicting\nviews have been expressed in those cases as to which Court has jurisdiction 'as between the Federal High Court and the State High Courts in disputes between an\nindividual customer and his bank. In the following cases, it was held that it is the State High Courts which have exclusive jurisdiction: Bi Zee Bee Hotels Ltd. v. Allied\nBank (Nig.) Ltd. (1996) 8 NWLR (Pt. 465) 176; N.I.D.B. v. Fembo (Nig.) Ltd. (1997) 2 NWLR (Pt. 489) 543; UBN Plc. v. Integrated Timber & Plywood Produces Ltd. (2000)\n12 NWLR (Pt. 680) 99; Paico (Press & Books) Ltd. v. CBN (2001) 3 NWLR (Pt. 700) 347. On the other hand, in the following cases it was held that both the Federal High\nCourt and the State High Courts have concurrent jurisdiction: NDIC v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (1997) 2 NWLR (Pt. 490) 735; Afribank (Nig.) Plc. v. K.C.G. (Nig.)\nLtd. (2001) 8 NWLR (Pt. 714) 87. This last case came to that view relying on the decision of the Supreme Court in Federal\n38\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n44/145\nMortgage Bank of Nigeria v. NDIC (1999) 2 NWLR (Pt. 591) 333 which heard the appeal from the Court of Appeal in NDIC v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (supra).\nIn the said NDIC v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (1997) 2 NWLR (Pt. 490) 735 in which I wrote the leading judgment in the Court of Appeal, the earlier Court of\nAppeal decisions, namely Bi Zee Hotels and Fembo Nigeria were not cited to the Court. If they had been cited, they would have been considered whether in fact they\nhad decided the matter in issue by which the Court of Appeal ought to be bound. Mr. Clarke, on behalf of the respondent, submits that the pronouncement on the\nproviso in Section 230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution as amended by Decree No. 107 of 1993 in the NDIC v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (supra) was obiter. Mr.\nClarke did not explain why he made that submission in his brief of argument in response to this appeal. I think, however, he simply echoed the view expressed by the\nCourt below. The Court below held the view, that the pronouncement I made in that case was an obiter dictum because, according to Oguntade, JCA, the issues\nbefore the Court of Appeal in that case\n39\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n45/145\n\"did not include a determination of whether or not the Federal High Court has a concurrent jurisdiction with a State High Court in a dispute between an individual\ncustomer and his bank.\" He set out the three issues considered in that case, the first of which reads:\n\"Whether by virtue of Section 230(1)(d) of the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree No. 107 of 1993, a State High Court has any jurisdiction left to\nentertain in any dispute between two banks relating to banking transactions.\" (Italics mine).\nHe observed and concluded thus: \"As I stated earlier, the issue did not properly arise in the Court of Appeal case N.D.I.C. v. F.M.B.N. The judicial authorities which remain\nbinding on this Court in the matter are Bi Zee Bee Hotels Ltd. v. Allied Bank (Nig.) Ltd. (supra) and NIDB v. Fembo (Nig.) Ltd. (supra). As was held by the Court of Appeal\nin the two cases, I hold the view that in disputes between an individual customer and his bank, only a State High Court has jurisdiction.\"\nLooking at the above issue, I should have thought it elementary that the nature of the dispute between the two banks and the respective capacities in which\n40\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n46/145\nthey acted in the banking transaction as revealed in the case would have to be ascertained in order to understand the phrase whether \"a State High Court has any\njurisdiction left to entertain any dispute between two banks relating to banking transactions,\" so as to answer the issue arising from the arguments of counsel. In so\ndeciding, what jurisdiction was left to the State High Courts, one may come to whether it is exclusive or concurrent. But certainly, the question suggests that there was\na dispute over the jurisdiction exercisable by the State High Court in the subject matter. The action itself arose from a customer and bank relationship. A sum of money\nhad been deposited by the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria with a Commercial Bank (United Commerce Bank Limited) which later went into liquidation. An action had\nbeen commenced in the Lagos State High Court before the liquidator (NDIC) came in and objected at a stage that by virtue of Section 230(1)(d) (as amended), only\nthe Federal High Court had jurisdiction. The Lagos State High Court overruled the objection. The matter eventually got to the Court of Appeal and the issue in question\nwas raised. In fact,\n41\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n47/145\nthe arguments of counsel for both parties raised the question as to the meaning of Section 230(1)(d), and they were on diametrically opposite directions. One\ncontended that the Federal High Court had exclusive jurisdiction; the other that the State High Courts had exclusive jurisdiction. The two parties were banks and the\ntransaction was that one had lodged money with the other on interest basis. The arguments touched on whether that was a customer and bank relationship and the\neffect under Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0in regard to the dispute. This was recorded thus at page 754:\n\"But it appears a controversy still remains as to what the proviso to Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0means. Professor Olawoyin on behalf of the appellant argues that when one bank\ninvests money in another bank upon interest and a dispute later ensues, any civil cause arising from that transaction (referred to by him as 'inter-bank placements') is\nin respect of an action' between one bank and another which must be heard by the Federal High Court to the exclusion of a State High Court by virtue of Section\n230(1)(d) of Decree No. 107 of 1993.\nOn the other hand, Mr. Fagbohungbe on behalf of the\n42\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n48/145\nrespondent submits that the respondent was created by the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria Decree No.7 of 1977 and not licensed under the Banks and Other\nFinancial Institutions Decree No. 25 of 1991 (the BOFID). He says that under Section 61 of the BOFID, 'bank' means a bank licensed under the said BOFID. He therefore\nboldly argues that the respondent is not a bank as defined under Section 61 of the BOFID. He contends further that the respondent was merely an 'investor' with the\nUnited Commercial Bank Limited (now appellant) and not a 'customer', and that therefore the Lagos State High Court has jurisdiction to hear the action.\"\nThe argument of Professor Olawoyin that when one bank invested money in another bank upon interest that amounted to 'inter bank placements' and did not\nconstitute customer and bank relationship, was rejected. Also, the argument of Mr. Fagbohungbe that the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria was not a bank but an\ninvestor and not a customer of the United Commercial Bank Limited, was similarly rejected. The facts that clearly and eventually emerged before the Court were those\nof customer and bank relationship and the question which\n43\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n49/145\narose therefrom was which Court had jurisdiction. The issue that was raised whether a State High Court still has any jurisdiction left by virtue of the said Section 230(1)\n(d) must, I think, be taken along with the argument of the appellant that the Federal High Court had exclusive jurisdiction and that of the respondent that it was the\nLagos State High Court that had jurisdiction. I should have thought, when that was done, one could not avoid taking a decision, upon a rational approach, to support\none of the parties, or to rule against both and state where indeed jurisdiction lay, namely, in both Courts as appropriate. But a convoluted approach, the Court below\nengaged in the present case is bound to miss the merit and inevitability of resolving that issue the way it was. I think, therefore, it is idle to reason or submit that the\nissue leading to the pronouncement that both the Federal High Court and the State High Courts have concurrent jurisdiction did not arise for consideration and\ndecision in that judgment.\nBefore going to what the Supreme Court held on appeal in that case, let me return to whether the Court of Appeal had earlier considered Section\n44\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n50/145\n230(1)(d)\u00a0and given a decision on it. In Bi Zee Bee Hotels Ltd. (supra), although one of the issues was \"assuming the appeal is competent whether the Federal High\nCourt had jurisdiction to entertain the action which bothers (sic) on banker and customer relationship,\" the Court of Appeal came to the conclusion that the appeal\nwas incompetent and struck it out. It was thereafter that it was said at page 185 thus:\n\"Even if I consider the appeal on its merit, I would have dismissed it as lacking in merit.\nI say this because having regard to the material placed before the learned trial Judge and the state of the law, that is the proviso to Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0set out above, I\nquite agree with the learned trial Judge that the jurisdiction of his Court is ousted from determining the complaint of the appellant as formulated from the statement of\nclaim.\nThe fanciful but misconceived arguments advanced by the counsel for the appellant in trying to draw a distinction between individual banker and non-individual\nbanker as he put it, is a non-starter and with all due respect, I do not buy it. This is because the state of the law as it is now makes or even\n45\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n51/145\nsuggest no such a distinction.\"\nIt is obvious that Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0was not considered as part of the case before the Court and a decision reached on it in the Bi Zee Bee Hotels case. What was said\nwas a comment in passing after the appeal before the Court had been struck out for being incompetent. That cannot constitute a binding authority.\nAs for Fembo Nigeria Ltd. (supra), only three issues were before the Court, one of which was \"whether or not the lower Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate on the\nplaintiffs' case.\" The other two had no relevance remotely with Section 230(1)(d). The contention as reported at page 563 of the report was in regard to whether a\ncompany whose shares are wholly owned by the federal government was a federal government agency under Section 230(1)(q),\u00a0(r)\u00a0and (s). The pronouncement at\npage 564 on Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0was simply by the way in reliance on Bi Zee Bee Hotels Ltd. (supra). It had no bearing with the issue and no argument had been\nproffered on it. I would leave it at that. I have dealt with these cases because the respondents' counsel strongly relied on them and the Court below said it was bound\nby them.\n46\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n52/145\nObviously, those decisions, in any event, wrongly interpreted Section 230(1)(d).\nAs I have already indicated, NDIC v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (supra) came on appeal to this Court as Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria v. NDIC (1999) 2 NWLR\n(Pt. 591) 333. What I said there, in connection with Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0was copiously reproduced by Ogundare, JSC in his leading judgment at pages 361-362 when\nconsidering question 4 raised by the cross-appellant which was stated thus:\n\"4. Does Lagos State High Court share a concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal High Court in respect of banker-customer disputes/transactions as provided in the\nproviso to Section 230(1)(d) of Decree No. 107 of 1993?\"\nThis was obviously a direct question arising from issue 1 which had been raised in the Court below and decided as already shown. I do not intend to reproduce all what\nOgundare, JSC culled from my observation in that case in the Court below. It is fairly long. But part of what I said, which the learned trial Justice set out and considered,\nreads thus:\n\"A bank is an individual legal entity. It can be an individual customer to any other person when not\n47\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n53/145\nacting as a bank. So it is that, it can be an individual customer to a bank in any particular transaction depending on the type of transaction .... But if one bank as an\nindividual is interested in earning interest from another bank through deposit, then the relationship of individual customer and bank is established as in the present\ncase. Any dispute arising from that transaction is triable in the State High Court as well as in the Federal High Court.\" (Italics mine)\nThis was after I had given full consideration to the effect of a proviso in an enactment and as it applied to Section 230(1)\u00a0and the said case. Reacting to the above,\nalong with the argument of counsel, Ogundare, JSC at page 362 said:\n\"The respondent was unhappy with this conclusion and this forms the kernel of its cross-appeal. It is contended that, by virtue of the provisions of Section 230(1)(d)\nof the Constitution, the High Court of Lagos State lacked competence and jurisdiction to entertain the action brought by the plaintiff against another bank, the\ndefendant in this case. It is the further contention of the respondent that any action between one bank and another falls\n48\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n54/145\nwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court.\nIt is the contention of the plaintiff, that the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant leading to the action in the High Court of Lagos State was a dispute\nbetween an individual customer and his bank which is exempted from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court by the proviso in Section 230(1)(d). It is\nsubmitted that the plaintiff, in relation to that transaction, was an individual customer to the defendant. ...\nI have considered the arguments advanced by the parties. I agree entirely with the reasoning of the Court below. With respect to the learned counsel for the\nrespondent, I do not share the view that the proviso in Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0would not apply where in a customer/banker relationship, the customer is a bank. To say that\nwhere there is a dispute between two banks, the forum for the resolution of the dispute is the Federal High Court is to read into Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0what is not there. A\nlot depends on the nature of the transaction between the two banks. The facts show that plaintiff, like any other customer, placed a short term deposit with\n49\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n55/145\nthe defendant on agreed interest. After some roll overs, plaintiff sought to retrieve its deposit and interest but defendant defaulted. In the absence of any evidence to\nthe contrary about the custom in the industry, I must hold that it is a simple customer/banker relationship which the proviso in Section 230(1)(d)\u00a0exempts from the\nexclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court.\" (Italics mine)\nIn the face of the above, the Court below, per Oguntade, JCA said:\n\"It is apparent, that the Supreme Court did not discuss the issue of concurrent jurisdiction in relation to the matter\" even though it was question 4 which the Court fully\nconsidered.\nThe respondents' counsel also cited and relied on this Court's decision in Trade Bank Plc. v. Benilux (Nig.) Ltd. (2003) 9 NWLR (Pt. 825) 416. There, the sole issue was\nwhether the High Court of Lagos State is vested with jurisdiction to hear and determine the respondent's claim against his banker for improperly paying a cheque\nmarked \"Not Negotiable\" in favour of the plaintiffs to a third party. It was a case of conversion arising from customer and bank relationship. It was held that the High\n50\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n56/145\nCourt of Lagos State had jurisdiction to entertain the claim. The leading judgment by Mohammed, JSC was supported, in this regard by all the other four learned\nJustices. But respondents' counsel quoted the observation of Tobi, JSC in his supporting judgment in that case and relied on it to argue that the proviso in Section\n230(1)(d)\u00a0is not merely to relax the exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the Federal High Court in matters stated in the proviso but that rather, \"the purport is to wholly,\ntotally and absolutely deprive the Federal High Court of jurisdiction in respect of matters coming thereunder.\" At page 432, Tobi, JSC said:\n\"Section 230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution as amended by the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree No. 107 of 1993 vests exclusive original\njurisdiction on the Federal High Court 'in respect of banking, banks, other financial institutions including any action between one bank and other, any action by or\nagainst the Central Bank of Nigeria arising from banking, foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letter of credit, promissory note and other fiscal\nmeasures. The provision can only be invoked on\n51\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n57/145\nbanking transactions in respect of bank inter se including the Central Bank. By the proviso, the Sub-Section will not apply to any dispute between an individual\ncustomer and his bank in respect of transaction between an individual customer and a bank.\"\nWhat I understand was implied from the Judgment along with the observation of Tobi, JSC is that the Federal High Court has no exclusive jurisdiction in such a cause or\nmatter because of the proviso. That is the true legal position. I cannot understand why learned counsel for the respondent relied on the said observation unless, as it\nseems, he clearly misconceived it.\nI must now proceed formally to analyse Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution [same as Section 230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution]. I have already set the\nprovision out in this judgment. It provides that the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters\narising from -\n\"(d) banking, banks, other financial institutions including any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the Central Bank of Nigeria arising from\nbanking, foreign\n52\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n58/145\nexchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letters of credit, promissory notes and other fiscal measures.\"\nIt will be seen that this provision is differently worded from the provision of Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the 1973 Decree\u00a0 which dealt with \"banking, foreign exchange,\ncurrency or other fiscal measures.\" It was this wording, that led this Court in Jammal case to interpret the word \"banking\" as used therein to mean \"banking measures\"\nunder the ejusdem generis rule. It would appear that the law giver reacted to that interpretation in the majority decision and also the opinion of the minority decision,\nand if I may say, as well as the concerns expressed in both Jammal case and Bronik case where specifically it was said in Jammal case that \"We would require a clearer\nand more definitive provision than that in Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Decree before submission of both Chief Williams for the appellants and the learned attorney-\ngeneral that jurisdiction in 'all banking matters' throughout the federation and whatever their nature has in fact been exclusively vested in the Federal Revenue Court.\"\nIt can be seen that Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0was meant\n53\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n59/145\nto give the Federal High Court exclusive jurisdiction in \"banking\" in the wide sense to involve all banking transactions see the definition given in the Black's Law\nDictionary (supra). That conclusion cannot be resisted in view of the open ended text of that provision. But having contemplated conferring exclusive jurisdiction on\nthe Federal High Court in all the items stipulated in paragraph (d), which by the language used was indeed conferred, the law giver then introduced a proviso thus:\n\"Provided that this Paragraph shall not apply to any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer\nand the bank.\"\nIn considering the effect of the proviso in question, the import of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred on the Federal High Court under Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999\nConstitution should not be lost sight of. The Section begins with, \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution ...\" This takes account of the\njurisdiction of the High Court of a State in Section 272 (1) of the 1999 Constitution which says, \"Subject to the provisions of Section 251 and other\n54\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n60/145\nprovisions of the Constitution, the High Court of a State shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil proceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal\nright, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue. This is not a provision conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the State High Courts. Section 251\n(1)(d)\u00a0confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court in specified matters notwithstanding Section 272(1).\nAs has been observed, Section 251(1) of the 1999 Constitution begins with \"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution\" while Section\n272(1)\u00a0is specifically made \"subject to the provisions of Section 251.\" When the term \"notwithstanding\" is used in a Section of a Statute, it is meant to exclude an\nimpinging or impeding effect of any other provision of the Statute or other subordinate legislation so that the said Section may fulfill itself. It follows that, as used in\nSection 251(1) of the 1999 Constitution, no provision of that Constitution shall be capable of undermining the said Section.\u00a0In regard to Section 272\n55\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n61/145\nof the Constitution, Section 251\u00a0is directly relevant in that the former is made subject to it. The expression \"subject to\" means liable, subordinate, subservient, or\ninferior to, governed or affected by, provided that or provided;' answerable for see Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition, page 1425.\nIt must therefore be understood that \"subject to\" introduces a condition, a restriction, a limitation, a proviso see Oke v. Oke (1974) 1 ALL NLR (Pt. 1) 443 at 450. It\nsubordinates the provisions of the subject section to the section empowered by reference thereto and which is intended not to be diminished by the subject section\nsee LSDPC v. Foreign Finance Corporation (1987) 1 NWLR (Pt. 50) 413 at 461; Aqua Ltd. v. Ondo State Sports Council (1988) 4 NWLR (Pt. 91) 622 at 655.\nThe expression generally implies that what the section is subject to shall govern, control and prevail over what follows in that subject section of the enactment, so that\nit renders the provision to which it is subject to conditional upon compliance with or adherence to what is prescribed in the provision referred\n56\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n62/145\nto see Tukur v. Government of Gongola State (1989) 4 NWLR (Pt. 117) 517 at 542,565,580; ldehen v. ldehen (1991) 6 NWLR (Pt. 198) 382 at 148; Labiyi v. Anretiola (1992) 8\nNWLR (Pt. 258) 139 at 163-164.\nPlainly, the proviso in question in Section 251(1)(d), to put it in simple analysis, says that the Federal High Court will have exclusive jurisdiction in banking matters but\nwhen what is involved is individual customer and his bank transaction, the Federal High Court shall not have exclusive jurisdiction. Understandably, that was to\nrecognise the jurisdiction the State High Courts had been exercising in such matters which Section 272(1) of the Constitution impliedly preserves. The High Court of a\nState can only exercise jurisdiction in any aspect of such specified matters to the extent that the proviso in Section 251 (1)( d)\u00a0permits. The said proviso\u00a0cannot be\ninterpreted to have the effect of conferring exclusive jurisdiction on the State High Courts and completely taking away the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to\nentertain causes and matters relating to individual customer\n57\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n63/145\nand bank transactions as was erroneously decided by the Court below and unsuccessfully argued before this Court by Chief Clarke. Alhaji Ibrahim, SAN has proffered\nclear argument in the appellant's brief in this regard.\nI think, I have sufficiently explained the rationale behind the interpretation adopted in Jammal case. I have also shown, that the provision of Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0is not\nliable to the ejusdem generis rule of interpretation. The words of Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0 are plain enough. It is the proviso that efforts must be made to understand.\nTherefore, one should be wary, in embarking on the interpretation of the proviso, not to be carried away by the history behind the jurisdiction of the Federal Revenue\nCourt, later Federal High Court. The first approach is to try to construe the plain words of Section 251 (1)(d). I must confess, that because of the way the Court below\ndealt with this matter and the arguments of counsel in this Court, I was compelled to forage into the past to explain the decisions in Jammal case and Bronik case with\nmuch profit. That is why, although I could have done without that history in this particular case where I\n58\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n64/145\nregard the language of Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0unambiguous, I consider it still valid that I must feel guided in this regard by the observation of Lord Heschell as to the proper\napproach when interpreting the plain words of a statute which he made in the House of Lords case of The Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers (1891) AC 107 at pages\n144-145 as follows:\n\"I think the proper course in the first instance is to examine the language of the statute and to ask what is the natural meaning, uninfluenced by any considerations\nderived from the previous state of the law, and not to start with inquiring how the law previously stood, and then, assuming that it was probably intended to leave it\nunaltered, to see if the words of the enactment will bear an interpretation in conformity with this view.\"\nThe learned Law Lord then proceeded to make further expatiation thus:\n\"If a Statute, intended to embody in a code, a particular branch of the law, is to be treated in this fashion, it appears to me that its utility will be almost entirely\ndestroyed, and the very object with which it was enacted will be\n59\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n65/145\nfrustrated. The purpose of such a statute surely was that on any point specifically dealt with by it, the law should be ascertained by interpreting the language used\ninstead of, as before, by roaming over a vast number of authorities in order to discover what the law was, extracting it by a minute critical examination of the prior\ndecisions .... I am of course far from asserting that resort may never be had to the previous state of the law for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the\nprovisions of the code. If, for example, a provision be of doubtful import, such resort would be perfectly legitimate. Or, again, if in a code of the law of negotiable\ninstruments, words be found which have previously acquired a technical meaning, or been used in a sense other than their ordinary one, in relation to such instruments,\nthe same interpretation might well be put upon them in the code .... What, however, I am venturing to insist upon is, that the first step taken should be to interpret the\nlanguage of the statute, and that an appeal to earlier decisions can only be justified on some special ground.\"\nThe Court of Appeal fell into the error of\n60\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n66/145\nadopting the contrary approach. Instead of construing Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0from the words used in the first instance, it rather sought the help of earlier authorities in a\nmanner that distorted a true interpretation necessary in this case. That was why I found myself compelled to revisit those authorities of Jammal and Bronik case to\nshow that they were both misunderstood and misapplied by that Court.\nAs a general rule, a proviso has a limited operation in qualifying the ambit of the section to which it is related see Llyods & Scottish Finance Ltd. v. Modern Cars &\nCaravans (Kingston) Ltd. (1964) 2 ALL ER 732 at 740. It follows that, where a Section with a proviso appended to it confers powers, it would be contrary to the ordinary\noperation of the proviso to give that Section an effect which would neutralise those powers in a way that it goes beyond what compliance with the proviso itself\nrenders necessary. The object of a proviso is normally, to cut down or qualify or create exceptions to or relax in a defined sense, the limitations imposed or powers\nconferred by a Section of an enactment or\n61\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n67/145\ndocument or to exclude some possible ground of misinterpretation of its extent, or to modify the main part of a section of a statute to which it relates or to restrain its\nabsoluteness or generality see Re Tabrisky ex parte Board of Trade (1947) 2 All ER 182 at 183-184 per Lord Greene, M. R. West Derby Union v. Metropolitan Life\nAssurance Co. (1897) AC 647 at 652 per Lord Watson.\nTherefore, the proper view of the proviso in Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution is that the main provision having used the language of exclusive jurisdiction, the\nproviso then relaxes that exclusiveness given to the Federal High Court therein in a situation in which the issue is a dispute between an individual customer and his\nbank in respect of transactions between the individual and the bank. In that regard, a State High Court will also have or continue to exercise jurisdiction and this it does\nconcurrently with the Federal High Court. There should be no difficulty in appreciating this.\nA further argument was made in connection with the provisions of Sections 3(1)(a) and 9 of Decree No. 18 of 1994 and Part 1 of the Schedule to the Decree No. 62 of\n1999\n62\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n68/145\nwhich amended Decree No. 18 of 1994. The Court below received arguments in respect of those provisions and expressed its opinion thereon per Oguntade, JCA as\nfollows:\n\"It seems to me that in so far as jurisdiction in disputes between individual customer and the bank has been vested in State High Courts, Sections 3(1) and 9 of the\nFailed Banks Decree as amended which vests jurisdiction on the same matters in the Federal High Court must be inconsistent with Section 251 (1)(d) of the 1999\nConstitution, makes it void to the extent of the inconsistency. Appellant's counsel has submitted that enactments conferring jurisdiction on the Federal High Court are\nexisting laws which must be brought in conformity with the 1999 Constitution pursuant to Section 315 of the 1999 Constitution. I entirely agree with him.\"\nHe did not indicate what the effect would be if the said Sections 3(1) and 9 of the Failed Banks Decree as amended by Decree No. 62 of 1999 were to be brought in\nconformity with the 1999 Constitution pursuant to Section 315. But what followed from the conclusion he arrived at to allow the appeal meant that he regarded those\nprovisions void entirely\n63\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n69/145\nbecause he said only the State High Courts have jurisdiction.\nThe appellant's argument in this regard falls under issues 2 and 3 set down in the appellant's brief. It was Decree No. 18 of 1994 under which the Tribunals were set up.\nSections 3(1)(a) and 9 provided thus:\n\"3(1) The Tribunal shall have power to\n(a) recover, in accordance with the provisions of this decree, the debts owed to a failed bank, arising in the ordinary course of business and which remain outstanding\nas at the date the bank is closed or declared a failed bank by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law, deed, agreement or memorandum of understanding, the tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and\ndetermine all matters brought before it concerning the recovery from any person of any debt owed to a failed bank, which remains outstanding as at the date of\nclosure of the business of the failed bank.\"\nParagraph 7 of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Decree No. 62 of 1999 which amended Decree No. 18 of 1994 reads inter alia:\n\"For the word 'Tribunal' wherever it appears in the Decree substitute the\n64\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n70/145\nwords 'Federal High Court.'\"\nThis enabled pending cases which the Tribunals did not conclude before they were abolished to be taken over by the Federal High Court.\nThe question that arose in the Court below was whether the foregoing provisions were inconsistent with Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution and therefore\nunconstitutional, null and void. The opinion of that Court and the final decision it reached have been stated above. It is necessary to add that Oguntade, JCA had earlier\nsaid:\n\"I hold the view that in dispute between an individual customer and his bank only a State High Court has jurisdiction.\" It is plain that from the whole tenor of the\njudgment of the Court below, the above stated pronouncements were made upon faulty premise and are inevitably wrong. One could recall how by the Regional Courts\n(Federation Jurisdiction) Act and related Acts jurisdiction was given to Regional High Courts (in the absence of a Federal Court) to adjudicate on matters within the\nexclusive competence of the Parliament. That arrangement was never intended to give exclusive jurisdiction to the Regional High Courts. It was, in my view, a\n65\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n71/145\ndesirable stopgap pending the establishment of a Federal Court. Decree No. 13 of 1973 which established the Federal Revenue Court, conferred it with exclusive\njurisdiction over some of the matters, but banking became one such matter which turned out to be contentious. Even after Decree No. 107 of 1993 which amended\nSection 230 of the 1979 Constitution was promulgated, curious claims were still being made by some that the State High Courts have exclusive jurisdiction to\nentertain an aspect of banking which involves individual customer and bank relationship. There is no rational basis, as has been shown, for holding that under Section\n251 (1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution, State High Courts have exclusive jurisdiction to determine disputes between an individual customer and his bank in respect of\ntransactions between the individual customer and the bank. It has been demonstrated that in such matters the Federal High Court and State High Courts have\nconcurrent jurisdiction.\nThere can be no doubt, that the intention of enacting Decree No. 18 of 1994 was to place all matters arising from failed banks, including individual customer and bank\nrelationship, within\n66\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n72/145\nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunals set up by the Federal Military Government. This was to ensure, I believe, that the \"crusade\" of the Federal Military Government\nto sanitize banking activities, maintained the momentum it could monitor and assess. There is also no doubt, that Decree No. 62 of 1999 was intended to keep it that\nway. It can be seen, therefore, that the Federal High Court by the said decrees had been directly conferred with exclusive jurisdiction over all failed banks matters. But\nthe ultimate position in this connection is that, although by Decree No. 18 of 1994 and Decree No. 62 of 1999, the Federal High Court was given exclusive jurisdiction in\nsuch matters, that provision of exclusivity has turned out to be inconsistent with the effect of the proviso to Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0when the 1999 Constitution came into\nforce. That does not mean that the effect of the inconsistency was to deprive the Federal High Court of any jurisdiction at all in matters of customer and bank. By virtue\nof Section 315 of the Constitution, those provisions in the said Decrees which are now regarded as existing Acts of the National Assembly, must be brought in line\n67\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n73/145\nwith the said proviso which extends jurisdiction to State High Courts. This must\u00a0be done with due reference to Sub-section (3) of Section 1 of the Constitution which\nprovides that:\n\"(3) If any other law is inconsistent with the provisions of this Constitution, this Constitution shall prevail, and that other law shall to the extent of the inconsistency be\nvoid.\"\nThe relevant provision of Section 315 is Sub-section (3)(d). it provides-\n\"(3) Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed as affecting the power of a Court of law or any Tribunal established by law to declare invalid any provision of an\nexisting law on the ground of inconsistency with the provision of any other law, that is to say -\"\n(d) any provision of this Constitution.\"\nThe extent of the inconsistency of Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended by Decree No. 62 of 1999 with Section 251 (1)( d) of the 1999 Constitution is that by giving the\nFederal High Court exclusive jurisdiction in the Failed Banks Recovery of Debts vis-a-vis customer and bank transactions, it is inconsistent with the proviso in\nParagraph (d) of Section 251(1)\u00a0which says the Federal High Court\n68\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n74/145\nshall not have exclusive jurisdiction in such matters. The said Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended by Decree No. 62 of 1999 will simply be read in the light that the\nFederal High Court shall have jurisdiction in matters of dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual\ncustomer and the bank. This will be consistent with the proviso in Paragraph (d) of Section 251 (1) of the 1999 Constitution. The Court below was therefore in error to\nhave declared Sections 3(1) and 9 of Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended by Decree No. 62 of 1999, Paragraph 7 of Part 1 of the Schedule thereto void.\nI have considered the preliminary objection to ground 4 in the notice of appeal filed on 6th January, 2004 relied on by the appellant and issue 4 formulated therefrom.\nThe said ground complains that the Court below erred in law when it failed to consider the relevance of the legal status of the appellant, its statutory duties and its role\nin the management of failed banks. Issue 4 raised therefrom, asks whether the suit instituted by the appellant against the respondents does not qualify as a suit\ninvolving \"other fiscal measures\"\n69\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n75/145\nwithin the meaning of Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0in which the federal government is interested. The whole purpose was to urge this Court to hold that the failed banks policy\nwhich became a major socio-economic issue under the auspices of the Federal Military Government are matters in which the NDIC, regarded as a federal government\nagency, has taken a decision and therefore should remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court by virtue of Section 251 (1)(r). I think there is merit\nin that objection. The said ground of appeal does not arise from the decision of the Court below. The issue was never canvassed in that Court and no leave was\nobtained to raise it as a new issue here. I accordingly hold that ground 4 is incompetent. I strike it out together with the said issue 4 formulated from it and the\nargument based on the said issue: see Honika Sawmill (Nig.) Ltd. v. Hoff (1994) 2 NWLR (Pt. 326) 252 at 26; Yusuf v. Union Bank of (Nig.) Ltd. (1996) 6 NWLR (Pt. 457) 632\nat 642.\nThere is, however, much merit in the appeal and I allow it. I set aside the judgment of the Court below together with the order for costs. I restore the decision\n70\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n76/145\nof the Federal High Court which assumes jurisdiction to entertain this suit. I award N6,000.00 as costs in the Court below and N10,000.00 as costs in this Court in\nfavour of the plaintiff/appellant.\nIDRIS LEGBO KUTIGI, J.S.C.: I have had the privilege of reading in advance the judgment just rendered by my learned brother Uwaifo, JSC. I agree with his reasoning and\nconclusions. I will however comment briefly.\nStarting with the respondents' preliminary objection, I will also uphold the objection to ground 4 of the appellant's grounds of appeal, because the ground does not\nrelate to any matter decided in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Clearly the legal status of the appellant, its statutory duties and its roles in the management of\nFailed Banks which ground 4 alleges that the Court of Appeal failed to consider were never issues before that Court nor were they canvassed by any of the parties in\nthat Court. Ground 4 and issue 4 founded on it are therefore incompetent and they are hereby struck out (see for example Odubeko v. Fowler (1993) 7 NWLR (Pt. 308)\n637; Agbaka v. Amadi (1998) 11 NWLR (Pt. 572) 16). Now, back to the\n71\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n77/145\nappeal proper.\nThis appeal is only concerned with the construction or interpretation of the proviso to Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution which reads thus -\n\"251 (1).Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an act of the\nNational Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters\n(a.) ...(omitted)\n(b.) ...(omitted)\n(c.) ...(omitted)\n(d.) connected with or pertaining to banking, banks, other financial institutions, including any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the Central\nBank of Nigeria arising from banking, foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letters of credit, promissory notes and other fiscal measures:\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer\nand the bank.\"\n(Italics is mine)\n72\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n78/145\nIt is a cardinal principle of interpretation, that where in their ordinary meaning, the provisions are clear and unambiguous, effect should be given to them as such (see\nfor example Awolowo v. Shagari (1979) 6 - 9 SC 51; Nafiu Rabiu v. State (1980) 8 -11 SC 130; Att.-Gen. of Bendel State v. Att.-Gen. of the Federation (1981) 3 NCLR 1, (1981)\n10 SC 1). A careful reading of Section 251(1)(d) above, shows the Federal High Court has exclusive jurisdiction in all matters specifically enumerated therein before the\nproviso. The problem here is therefore that of the construction of the proviso as it relates to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court in respect of the item or area\nstated in the proviso, that is, the provision\n\"any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer and the bank.\"\nThe question which easily comes to mind is: Does the proviso exclude the Federal High Court from exercising jurisdiction in the area contained therein? Or is the\nFederal High Court simply not allowed to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in the area, and in which case it\n73\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n79/145\nshares that jurisdiction concurrently with other Courts, in this case the States High Courts?\nThe proviso to my mind is intended not to deny the Federal High Court of jurisdiction in the matter or area stated therein. The proviso, is an exception to the\n\"exclusively,\" rule embodied in Section 251(1)(d). In other words, it is a proviso to the provision of Paragraph (d) of Section 251 Sub-section (1) only.\nNow, it should be appreciated that the words or provision\n\"any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between individual customer and the bank\"\ncovered by the proviso, is an area already covered by the main Paragraph (d) itself before the proviso. It will therefore, be unreasonable to read the proviso as totally\ndenying jurisdiction in an area where the main Paragraph (d) has already conferred jurisdiction. What the proviso has done in my view, therefore, is simply to remove\n\"exclusively\" of jurisdiction in the area stated in the proviso of Paragraph (d). In other words the Federal High Court can exercise concurrent jurisdiction in the area\nstated or mentioned in the proviso. To have stated, as did the\n74\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n80/145\nCourt of Appeal, that the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction at all, would have made the proviso superfluous or unnecessary because there are countless other\ncases in which the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction. We must in addition also avoid a construction which would have the effect of rendering the proviso otiose.\nThe appeal therefore succeeds and it is allowed.\nIt is for the above reasons and those ably stated in the judgment of my learned brother, Uwaifo, JSC that I also allow the appeal. For the avoidance of doubt, the\nconclusion is that under the proviso of Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution, the Federal High Court has concurrent jurisdiction with States High Courts in the\nmatter stated in the proviso (see Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria v. NDIC (1999) 2 NWLR (Pt. 591) 333; Afribank Nigeria Plc. v. K..C.G. Nigeria Ltd. (2001) 8 NWLR (Pt. 714)\n87.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal is set aside while the ruling delivered by the Federal High Court on 18/10/2000 is restored.\nI endorse the order for costs.\nALOYSIUS IYORGER KATSINA-ALU, J.S.C.: I have had the advantage of reading in draft\n75\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n81/145\nthe judgment delivered by my learned brother Uwaifo, JSC in this appeal. I entirely agree with his reasoning and conclusion and I, also, would allow the appeal. I only\nwish to make a few observations of my own on Sections 251(1)(d) and 272(1) of the 1999 Constitution. The main issue in this appeal is whether the State High Court\nhas been conferred with exclusive jurisdiction in \"disputes between an individual customer and his bank\" by the 1999 Constitution of this country. The starting point is\nSection 272(1) of the 1999 Constitution which confers jurisdiction on the State High Courts. It provides as follows:\n\"272-(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 251 and other provisions of the Constitution, the High Court of a State shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any\ncivil proceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue or to hear and determine any\ncriminal proceeding involving or relating to any penalty, forfeiture, punishment or other liability in respect of an offence committed by any person.\"\nSo what does Section 251 provide? It states thus:\n76\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n82/145\n251(1). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the\nNational Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters\n(a.) ...(omitted)\n(b.) ...(omitted)\n(c.) ...(omitted)\n(d.) connected with or pertaining to banking, banks, other financial institutions, including any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the Central\nBank of Nigeria arising from banking, foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letters of credit, promissory notes and other fiscal measures:\nProvided that this Paragraph shall not apply to any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer\nand the bank.\"\n(Italics is mine)\nThere are two things that I would like to observe from the above quoted provision of Section 272. The first is that whatever jurisdiction is vested in the State High Court\nby Section 272\u00a0is made subject to the jurisdiction vested in the\n77\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n83/145\nFederal High Court by or pursuant to Section 251 of the 1999 Constitution. The second thing to note is the absence of the adjective \"exclusive.\" Thus, it is necessary to\nbear in mind the provisions of Section 251\u00a0in construing the jurisdiction vested in the State High Court. In other words, Section 251 of the Constitution which confers\njurisdiction on the Federal High Court restricts, limits, governs and indeed prevails over Section 272 of the Constitution which confers jurisdiction on the State High\nCourt.\nIt is a cardinal principle of interpretation of Statutes that where the words of the Statute are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their plain and ordinary\nmeaning. See Owena Bank (Nig.) Plc. v. N.S.E. Ltd. (1997) 8 NWLR (Pt. 515) 1; A.-G. Bendel v. A.-G., Federation; Awolowo v. Shagari (1979) ALL NLR 12.\nIt will be seen clearly that Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal High Court in specified matters notwithstanding Section 272(1). What this\nmeans is that, the jurisdiction conferred upon and exercised by the State High Court hitherto in regard\n78\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n84/145\nto those specified matters has been removed. The proviso to Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0however exempts any dispute between an individual customer and his bank from the\nexclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. What this means is this. The proviso has done two things. First, the jurisdiction of the State High Court in transactions\ninvolving an individual customer and his bank has been preserved. In the second place, although the Federal High Court has jurisdiction in such disputes, it is not to the\nexclusion of the State High Court. In other words, both Courts have concurrent jurisdiction. That is to say that under the proviso to Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999\nConstitution, the Federal High Court has concurrent jurisdiction with State High Court in transactions involving an individual customer and his bank see Federal\nMortgage Bank of Nigeria v. NDIC (1999) 2 NWLR (Pt. 591) 333.\nAs I stated earlier on in this judgment, I entirely agree with the reasoning and conclusion of my learned brother Uwaifo, JSC. In the result, I, too, allow the appeal and set\naside the judgment of the Court of Appeal together with the order for costs. I restore the judgment of the\n79\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n85/145\nFederal High Court and also award N6,000.00 as costs in the Court of Appeal and N10,000.00 as costs in this Court in favour of the plaintiff/appellant.\nUMARU ATU KALGO, J.S.C.: I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgment just delivered by my learned brother Uwaifo, JSC in this appeal. I entirely agree\nwith the judgment and the treatment of the issues raised therein. I adopt his reasoning and conclusions as mine and find that the appeal is meritorious. I therefore\nallow it but add a few words of mine by way of emphasis.\nI have considered the preliminary objection raised by the learned counsel for the respondents in his brief, pertaining to ground of appeal number 4 and issue 4 distilled\nfrom it and I agree with Uwaifo, JSC that it did not arise in the Court below and no leave was obtained before it was filed in this Court. It is therefore incompetent and is\naccordingly struck out together with the issue raised from it and the arguments relating thereto.\nThe substantive issue in controversy between the parties in this appeal is whether the Federal High Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine \"disputes\n80\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n86/145\nbetween an individual customer and his bank\". In considering this issue, it is my respectful view that the provisions of Decree\u00a0107 of 1993, Decree 18 of 1994; Decree\n62 of 1999 and most importantly Section\u00a0251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution, among others must be considered.\nDecree No. 107 of 1993 amended the 1979 Constitution and in Section\u00a0230(1)(d)\u00a0provides:-\n\"(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the\nNational Assembly or a Decree, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters arising from-\n(d) banking, banks, other financial institutions, including any action between one bank and other, any action by or against the Central Bank of Nigeria arising from\nbanking, foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letter of credit, promissory note and other fiscal measures:\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual\ncustomer and\n81\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n87/145\nthe bank.\"(Italics mine)\u00a0\nSections 3 (1) and 9 of Decree No 18 of 1994 (popularly called the Failed Bank Decree) as amended by Decree No 62 of 1999 also provide as follows:-\n\"3(1) The Federal High Court shall have power to\n(a) recover in accordance with the provisions of this decree, the debts owed a failed bank, arising in which remain outstanding as at date the bank was closed or\ndeclared a failed bank by the Central Bank of Nigeria\".\n\"9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law, deed, agreement or memorandum of understanding, the Federal High Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to\nhear and determine all matters brought before it concerning the recovery from any person of any debt owed to a failed bank which remains outstanding as at the date\nof closure of business of the failed bank\".\nFrom these provisions of Decree 107 of 1993 and Decree\u00a018 of 1994 as amended by Decree\u00a062 of 1999, it is very clear that in both provisions, the Federal High Court\nwas given exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine civil causes and matters arising from banking and other fiscal measures. It is also clear however, that in respect\nof\n82\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n88/145\nDecree\u00a0107 of 1993, the exclusivity was limited or curtailed by removing dispute between individual customer and his bank.\nIt is trite law, that the general principles of interpretation of statutes is that where the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous, they must be given their plain\nand ordinary meaning unless it would be absurd to do so having regard to the nature and circumstances of the case. See Awolowo v. Shagari (1979) ALL NLR 12; (1979) 6\n- 9 SC 51; Adejumo v. Governor of Lagos State (1972) 3 SC 47;\nA.-G., Bendel v. A.-G., Federation (1982) 3 NCLR 1, (1981) 10 SC 1; Owena Bank (Nig.) Plc. v. N.S.E. Limited (1997) 8 NWLR (Pt. 515) 1.\nSection 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria also provides:\n\"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the\nNational Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters -\n...\n(d) connected with or pertaining to banking, banks, other\n83\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n89/145\nfinancial institutions, including any action by or against the Central Bank of Nigeria arising from banking foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letters\nof credit, promissory notes and other fiscal measures:\nProvided that this paragraph shall not apply to any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual\ncustomer and the bank\".\n(Italics mine)\nOnce again, this provision also gives the Federal High Court exclusive jurisdiction in civil causes and matters pertaining to banking and other fiscal matters but like\nSection\u00a0230(1)(d) of Decree 107 of 1993, it limits the exclusivity by removing from that jurisdiction, disputes between individual customer and his bank.\nThe removal of exclusivity from the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court in respect of disputes between individual customer and his bank by the proviso's in\nSection\u00a0230(1)(d) of Decree 107 of 1993 and Section\u00a0251(1)(d) of 1999 Constitution does not mean that the Federal High Court ceased to have jurisdiction in respect\nof those disputes but it only, means that\n84\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n90/145\nthe jurisdiction is not exclusive to the Federal High Court. It is pertinent to observe that Decree\u00a0107 of 1993 ceased to have effect and was repealed by Decree\u00a063 of\n1999 with effect from 29th May, 1999. This means that S.\u00a0251 of the 1999 Constitution now deals with jurisdiction and powers of the Federal High Court in banking\nmatters.\nThe Court of Appeal found that Sections 3(1) and 9 of the Decree\u00a018 of 1994 were inconsistent with the provisions of Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution and\ntherefore null and void. It said in its judgment on page 114 of the record -\n\"It seems to me that in so far as jurisdiction in disputes between individual customer and the bank has been vested in the State High Courts, Sections 3(1) and 9 of the\nFailed Banks Decree as amended which vests jurisdiction on the same matters in the Federal High Court must be inconsistent with Section 251 (1)( d) of the 1999\nConstitution. In that case Section 1(3) of the 1999 Constitution makes it void to the extent of the inconsistency\".\nWith due respect to the Court of Appeal, Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution does not confer exclusive jurisdiction in disputes\n85\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n91/145\nbetween individual customer and the bank on the State High Courts. All it did is to remove the exclusivity in dealing with those kind of disputes from the Federal High\nCourt, which means that the High Court of a State by virtue of Section\u00a0272(1) of 1999 Constitution also shares the jurisdiction with the Federal High Court.\nThe phrase \"this paragraph shall not apply\" in the proviso to Section\u00a0251(1)(d)\u00a0means what it says, and that is that the exclusive jurisdiction on matters listed in Sub-\nsection (1) of S. 251 of the 1999 Constitution, does not apply to disputes between individual customer and his bank. It does not mean, that the Federal High Court\nshall have no jurisdiction in the simple customer/bank relationship at all. If that was the intention of the law maker, it would have said so expressly by simply providing\nthat the Federal High Court shall have no jurisdiction to hear and determine any such dispute.\nSection 272(1) provides:-\n\"(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 251 and other provisions of this Constitution, the High Court of a State shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any civil\nproceedings in which the existence or extent of a legal right, power, duty,\n86\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n92/145\nliability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue or to hear or determine any criminal proceedings involving or relating to any penalty, forfeiture, punishment or\nother liability in respect of an offence committed by any person\"\n(Italics mine)\nSection 272(1) of the 1999 Constitution, inter alia, vested jurisdiction on the State High Courts to hear and determine civil matters in which the existence or extent of\na legal right, power, duty, liability, privilege, interest, obligation or claim is in issue. But Section\u00a0272(1) is \"subject to the provisions of S. 251 and other provisions of the\nConstitution\". This means that the jurisdiction to hear and determine civil matters mentioned in Section\u00a0 272(1) is limited, restricted, regulated, controlled and\nsubordinated by the provisions of Section\u00a0 251. This further means that since the Federal High Court has no exclusive jurisdiction over \"any dispute between an\nindividual customer and his bank,\" in accordance with the proviso to Section\u00a0251, the jurisdiction will now be shared between the Federal High Court and the State High\nCourts by virtue of the provisions of Section\u00a0272(1) above. My conclusion therefore is that the\n87\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n93/145\nFederal High Court and the State High Court have concurrent jurisdiction to hear and determine any disputes between an individual customer and his bank and I so\nhold.\nI find it useful and worthwhile, to consider cases decided by this Court on the construction of Section\u00a0230(1)(d) of Decree 107 of 1993 whose provisions are in pari\nmateria with those of Section\u00a0251(1)(d) of 1999 Constitution. In Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria Ltd. v. N.D.I.C. (1999) 2 NWLR (Pt. 591) 333 at 362-363 Ogundare, JSC\nin his leading judgment said:\n\"with respect to the learned counsel for the respondent, I do not share the view that the proviso in Section 230(1)(d) would not apply where in a customer/banker\nrelationship, the customer is a bank. To say that where there is dispute between two banks, the forum for resolution of the dispute is the Federal High Court is to read\ninto Section 230(1)(d) what is not there ... In the absence of any evidence to the contrary about the custom in the industry, I must hold that it is a simple\ncustomer/banker relationship which the proviso in Section 230(1)(d) exempts from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court.\"\n(Italics\n88\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n94/145\nmine).\nI entirely agree with Ogundare, JSC that the proviso to Section 230(1)(d) did not provide that it would not apply where two banks are involved in the dispute or that\nonly the Federal High Court has jurisdiction in such disputes. To say so, is to read or add what is not in the proviso and this cannot be done. He only ended, quite\nproperly in my view, by saying that in a simple customer/banker relationship, like in the present case, the proviso only exempts the application of the exclusive\njurisdiction of the Federal High Court. This means in my respectful view, that the Federal High Court will still have the ordinary, as opposed to the exclusive jurisdiction\nin banker/customer disputes. He did not say that the Federal High Court lacks such jurisdiction.\nAlso in Trade Bank Plc. v. Benilux (Nig.) Ltd. (2003) 9 NWLR (Pt. 825) 416 at page 430 Mohammed, JSC in the leading judgment had this to say:-\n\"The State High Court has no jurisdiction in matters provided under Section 230(1)( d) of Decree 107 except disputes between an individual customer and his bank in\nrespect of a\n89\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n95/145\ntransaction between the individual customer and the bank.\"\nI cannot agree more with this. What the learned trial Justice is saying is that except as to disputes between individual customer and his bank, all other matters\npertaining to banking in Section 230(1)(d) of Decree 107 of 1993 are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court. He is not saying that the Federal High\nCourt cannot exercise a jurisdiction over disputes between the individual customer and his bank.\nIt is true, that in these two cases of this Court considered by me, the mind of the learned Justices did not avert to concurrent jurisdiction between the Federal High\nCourt and the State High Court under the proviso to Section 230(1)(d). That does not stop this Court from clearing the issue when the opportunity occurs like in the\ninstant appeal where the construction or interpretation of the similar provisions as in Section 230(1)(d) arises.\nI have also carefully studied the cases of Jammal Steel Structures Ltd v. A.C.B. Ltd. (1973) 1 ALL NLR (Pt. 11) 208 and Bronik Motors Ltd. v.Wema Bank (1983) 1 SCNLR 296\nand it appears to me that they are not relevant to this case.\n90\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n96/145\nThe Jammal's case was considering the jurisdiction of the then Federal Revenue Court now Federal High Court under Section\u00a07(1)(b)(iii) of the Federal Revenue\nCourt Act, 1973. This Court was of the opinion that the Federal Revenue Court as the name implies was established to essentially take care of the revenue of the\nFederal Government and since Section\u00a07(1)(b)(iii) of the Act did not specifically give exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal Revenue Court in all banking transactions, it\nheld in a majority decision per Elias, CJN at pages 222-223 of the report that:-\n\"It does not seem to us that the legislative intention behind the Decree was to clutter up the new Revenue Court with ordinary cases involving banker-customer\nrelationships, such as disputes in respect of an overdraft, or the negligent payment of a forged cheque or negligent dishonouring of a customer's cheques all \"banking\ntransactions\" having nothing to do with Federal revenue concern. All the State High Courts and other appropriate Courts must continue to exercise their jurisdiction in\nthese and similar matters if the Federal Revenue Court must be allowed to concentrate on its\n91\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n97/145\nessentially revenue protection functions\".\nBy this decision, both the Federal High Courts and the State High Courts can exercise jurisdiction in all banking transactions involving banker-customer relationship by\nvirtue of the 1979 Constitution. Their jurisdiction in such banking transaction shall therefore be concurrent even though Section\u00a07(1)(b)(iii) did not say so expressly.\nIn the Bronik Motors case the provisions of Section\u00a0230 of the 1979 Constitution were considered by this Court. The section provides:\n\" 230(1) subject to the provisions of this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the National Assembly, the\nFederal High Court shall have jurisdiction -\"\n(a) in such matters connected with or pertaining to the revenue of the government of the federation as may be prescribed by the National Assembly; and\n(b) in such other matters as may be prescribed as respects which the National Assembly has power to make laws.\n(2) Notwithstanding Sub-section (1) of this Section, where by law, any Court established before the date when this Section comes into force is empowered to exercise\n92\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n98/145\njurisdiction for the hearing and determination of any of the matters to which Sub-section (1) of this Section relates, such Court shall as from the date when this\nsection comes into force be restyled \"Federal High Court\", and shall continue to have all the powers and exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon it by any law\".\nThis Court held that the words \"as may be prescribed\" in Section 230(1)(a) and (b) can only refer to the future i.e. the National Assembly may prescribe at a future\ndate additional jurisdiction on the Federal High Court in matters connected with or pertaining to the revenue of government and in other matters contained in the\nexclusive legislative list. Nnamani, JSC in the leading judgment had this to say:-\n\"As regards the proper meaning of \"as may be prescribed?' which occur in Section 230(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, it is my view that those words should be\ngiven their ordinary, plain meaning ... I cannot see how \"as may be prescribed\" can refer to anything else but the future i.e. as the National Assembly may prescribe at\nthe future date subsequent to the coming into operation of the 1979 Constitution\".\nAt the\n93\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n99/145\ntime of the decision, that jurisdiction has not been conferred. And although Section 7(1)(b (iii) of the Federal Revenue Act, 1973 has conferred certain jurisdiction in\nthe exclusive legislative list on the Federal High Court, there are still left other matters connected with \"banking\" in the said list which was not conferred on that Court.\nTherefore by virtue of the provisions of Section 236 of the 1979 Constitution, the State High Courts would necessarily have jurisdiction on matters not listed under\nSection 7(1)(b) (iii) of the said Act.\nAlthough, the decisions of this Court in Jammal and Bronik Motors cases deal with the jurisdiction of the Federal Revenue Court/Federal High Court, the relevant laws\nor constitutional provisions considered and interpreted therein are completely dissimilar and different from the constitutional provisions being considered in the\ninstant appeal.\nIt appears to me, that these two decisions agree that the Federal High Court does not have exclusive jurisdiction in banking and customer-banker relationships. It is\nalso very clear to me that Section 251(1)(d) of 1999 Constitution is very clear and not in pari materia with the provisions and Section\n94\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n100/145\n7(1)(b)(iii) of the Federal Revenue Court Act, 1973 or Section 230(1)(a) and (b) of the 1979 Constitution. To that extent, the decisions in the two cases above are\nirrelevant in the consideration of the instant appeal and I agree with the learned appellant's counsel, for saying so in his brief.\nDecree No 18 of 1994 as amended by Decree No 62 of 1999 is an existing law and under Section 315 of the 1999 Constitution, it takes effect with such modifications\nas may be necessary to bring it into conformity with the 1999 Constitution. It appears to me that the provisions of Sections 3(1)(a) and 9 of Decree No 18 of 1994 are\ninconsistent with the provisions of Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution and in that they do not attune to the proviso to Section 251 which removes the\nexclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court in customer-bank transactions. They are to that extent in conflict with the provisions of Section 251(1)(d) and therefore\ninconsistent with it.\nFrom what I have said above, I agree with the submissions of Alhaji Abdullahi Ibrahim, SAN both in his brief and in oral argument in Court that the two decisions\ndiscussed above relied upon by the Court of Appeal in\n95\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n101/145\nreaching its decision, are no authorities for saying that the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction in disputes between individual customer and his bank. I also find that\nthe interpretation of the jurisdiction conferred on the Federal High Court under Section\u00a0230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution as amended by Decree No 107 of 1993 and\nor S. 251(1)(d) of 1999 Constitution, by the Court of Appeal, was wrong in that the proviso to each of these sections did not take away, as it were, the whole jurisdiction\nof the Federal High Court in disputes between an individual customer and his bank. All it did was to remove the exclusive nature of that jurisdiction. In that case, both\nthe Federal High Court and the State High Courts by virtue of Section\u00a0272(1) of 1999 Constitution have concurrent jurisdiction in the matter as held by the trial Court.\nFor all what I have said above and the more detailed reasons contained in the judgment of my learned brother Uwaifo, JSC, I too find merit in this appeal. This appeal\ntherefore succeeds and is hereby allowed. I set aside the decision of the Court of Appeal and restore that of the trial Court. I abide by the order of costs made in the\n96\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n102/145\nleading judgment of Uwaifo, JSC.\nAKINTOLA OLUFEMI EJIWUNMI, J.S.C.: I have had the privilege of reading before now the draft of the judgment just delivered by my learned brother, Uwaifo, JSC. Though\nI am in entire agreement with his reasoning and the conclusion reached thereon upholding the appeal, yet I do intend to add a few words of my own by this judgment.\nThe genesis of this case, lies in the fact that the 1st respondent, who was a customer of the now defunct Allied Bank of Nigeria Plc., had with the said bank several\naccounts and was the beneficiary of credit facilities and or loans from the bank. By the 31st of January, 1979 the 1st respondent was indebted to the bank in the sum of\nN284,108,459.49. Following the revocation of the licence by the Central Bank, the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation the appellant, was appointed as the liquidator\nof the bank. Pursuant to the appointment, the appellant then filed an application for the recovery of the debt against the respondents under the provisions of the\nFailed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices Decree No. 18 of 1994. And by Decree No. 62 of 1999, Decree No. 18 of\n97\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n103/145\n1994 was amended, by substituting the Federal High Court for the tribunal. The suit was therefore accordingly, taken before the Federal High Court.\nAt the commencement of the hearing in that Court, the respondents filed a notice of objection to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to hear the suit upon the\nfollowing grounds. These are:-\n\"(1) The proviso to Section 251(1)(d) of the Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 repeats the terms of Section 230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution (as\namended by Decree No 107 of 1993) and did not vest in the Federal High Court the jurisdiction to determine causes and matters relating to transactions between an\nindividual customer and his bank.\n(2) The reliefs sought in this suit are matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State High Court.\n(3) All claims made or intended to be made by the plaintiff are a nullity since they are all claims and matters over which the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction.\n(4) Accordingly, the Federal High Court is devoid of jurisdiction to entertain the suit and the same should therefore be struck out.\"\nThe Federal High Court, per\n98\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n104/145\nAbutu, J., after receiving addresses by learned counsel in respect of the preliminary objection, then delivered a considered ruling. By this ruling, he came to the\nconclusion that in causes and matters between a bank and its individual customers, the Federal High Court and the State High Courts have concurrent jurisdiction to\nhear and determine such suits.\nAccordingly, the preliminary objection was overruled by the learned trial Judge.\nAs the respondents whose preliminary objection was so overruled, they appealed to the Court below. The questions raised in that Court were:-\n\"(i) Whether the learned trial Judge was right in holding that the present state of the law is that the Federal High Court has concurrent jurisdiction with State High\nCourts to entertain disputes between banks and their individual customers and thereby assumed jurisdiction to entertain the suit herein.\n(ii) Whether the learned trial Judge was correct in the decision that the Federal High Court is vested with jurisdiction to entertain the suit by virtue of the provisions of\nthe Failed Banks Decree as amended by the Tribunals (Certain Consequential Amendments etc)\n99\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n105/145\nDecree No. 62 of 1999\"\nThe Court below, following arguments by learned counsel for the parties delivered a considered ruling and concluded that the Court below was wrong to have held that\nthe Federal High Court and State High Court enjoy concurrent jurisdiction in respect of matters that form the subject matter of this suit. In effect, the Court below took\nthe view that the Federal High Court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine causes and matters arising from \"customer and bank relationship\", particularly as\ndisclosed upon the facts of the instant case. Not satisfied with that decision, the appellant has appealed against it. Pursuant thereto, the appellant in the brief filed in\nits behalf has set out the following issues for the determination of this appeal.\nThey read thus:-\n\"(1) Whether the Court below was right when it restricted itself to the provisions of Decree 107 of 1993 and Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution in considering\nwhether the position of the law as regards the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and State High Court in respect of transaction between individual customers and\ntheir bank had been altered since\n100\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n106/145\nthe time of the 1979 Constitution.\n(2) Whether Sections 3(1) and 9 of the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Decree No. 18 of 1994 (as amended by Decree No. 62\nof 1999) are inconsistent with Section 251 (1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution (sic) of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and are therefore unconstitutional, null and void.\n(3) Whether the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria conferred exclusive jurisdiction in disputes between an individual customer and his bank on the\nState High Courts.\n(4) Whether the suit instituted by the appellant against the respondents herein does not qualify as a suit involving 'other fiscal measures' (within the meaning of\nSection 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution) in which the Federal Government is interested as considered in previous decisions of this Honourable Court.\"\nAlthough, the respondents also in their brief, identified issues for the determination of the appeal, it is in my view unnecessary to set them out in this judgment as they\nwould be considered with the arguments advanced in their brief in support of their case. It is however pertinent to refer to the\n101\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n107/145\npreliminary objection they have raised against the 4th issue identified above for the appellant for the determination of this appeal. By this preliminary objection, the\nrespondents are urging that the said ground of appeal as well as the 4th issue and arguments thereon in the appellant's brief, be struck out or discountenanced on the\nground that the said ground of appeal did not arise from the decision of the Court below.\nHowever, before considering the arguments advanced in respect of these issues including those proffered with regard to the preliminary objection, I think it is desirable\nto set out the relevant parts of the judgment of the Court below that provoked this appeal. It is clear from a careful reading of the judgment of the Court per, Oguntade,\nJCA, who read the leading judgment, that in determining this controversy as he did, he referred to the Federal Revenue Court Act, 1973, by which the Federal High Court\nwas created and which was later changed by legislation to the Federal High Court. He also referred to some of the cases that were decided with regard to the\njurisdiction of that Court viz: - Jammal Steel Structures v. A. C.B.(1973) 1\n102\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n108/145\nALL NLR (Pt. 11) 208 at 220; Bronik Motors Ltd. v. Wema Bank (1983) 1SCNLR 296. And also the provisions of Section 230(1) of the 1979 Constitution, Decree No. 107 of\n1993 and Section\u00a0251 of the Constitution. The Court below therefore upon the basis of the aforementioned cases and the provisions of the Constitution, then said\nwith regard to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court in the context of the matter under consideration, as follows: -\n\"Now, the 1979 Constitution in relation to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court was amended by Decree No. 107 of 1993. Section 230(1)(d) of Decree No. 107 of\n1993 is in ipssissma verba with Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution reproduced above.\nIt is correct to say that prior to the coming into force of Decree No. 107 of 1993, the position was that the Federal High Court had a limited jurisdiction and the State\nHigh Court an unlimited jurisdiction. It is also the position that civil causes and matters arising from any dispute between an individual customer and his bank were\nunder the jurisdiction of the State High Court.\"\nThe Court below per Oguntade, JCA, then raised the question as to\n103\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n109/145\nwhether Decree No. 107 of 1993 and Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution have altered the position with regard to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and\nState High Court in such matters. And in order to answer the question so posed, the following cases were considered: Bi Zee Bee Hotels Ltd. v. Allied Bank (Nig.) Ltd.\n(1996) 8 NWLR (Pt. 465) 176; N.I.D.B. v. F.E.M.B.O.L (Nig.) (1997) 2 NWLR (Pt. 489) 543; where the Court below had held that in disputes between an individual customer\nand his bank, the State High Court has jurisdiction. But in N.D.I.C. v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (1997) 2 NWLR (Pt. 490) 735, the Court below per Uwaifo, JCA (as\nhe then was), took the view, inter alia, that in disputes between an individual customer and his bank, both the Federal High Court and the State High Court have and can\nexercise concurrent jurisdiction in such circumstances. Meanwhile, this case went on appeal to this Court as FMBN v. NDIC (1999) 2 NWLR (Pt. 591) 333. And the\nopinion of Uwaifo, JCA, as reiterated above was upheld. This decision of this Court brought to the attention of the Court below. It does seem to me\n104\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n110/145\nthat ordinarily the Court below ought to have followed the decision of this Court without much ado. The Court below, however, declined to follow that path endorsed by\nthe settled principle of stare decisis. But the Court below, sought to show that this Court should not have affirmed the decision of the Court below.\nThe premise for this position of that Court was because the judgment of the Court below, per Uwaifo, JCA, did not include a determination or whether or not the\nFederal High Court has a concurrent jurisdiction with a State High Court in a dispute between an individual customer and his bank. In other words it is being contended\nthat the judgment did not proceed from the decision of the High Court. It is undoubtedly settled law, that an appeal is usually against a ratio and not against an obiter\nexcept in cases where the obiter is so closely linked with the ratio as to be deemed to have radically influenced the ratio. But even there, the appeal is against the ratio.\nSee Saude v. Abdullahi (1989) 7 NWLR (Pt. 116) 387, 431; Ogunbiyi v. Ishola (1996) 6 NWLR (Pt. 452) 12, (1996) 9 SCNJ 143 at 153; Coker v. United Bank for Africa (1997) 2\nNWLR (Pt.\n105\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n111/145\n490) 641, (1997) 2 SCNJ 130, 145.\nBearing in mind this settled principle, I will now consider the facts in that case and the issues raised thereon from the High Court to the Court of Appeal and also\nwhether any of the issues so raised and considered by the appellate Courts arose from any of the issues that fell for determination in the High Court of Lagos. I will deal\nwith this question briefly. And in order to appreciate the purport of the action that went before the Court of Appeal and this Court, it is necessary to state some of the\nfacts as are pertinent to resolve the question raised above. It does appear that the plaintiff in N.D.I.C. v. F.M.B. (supra), took out a writ of summons against the United\nCommercial Bank Ltd., as defendant claiming repayment of the sum of N5,000,000.00 it deposited for 90 days period in 1992 and interests thereon. Also filed was a\nstatement of claim. The appellant did not enter appearance. And judgment was entered in favour of the respondent pursuant to Order 36 Rule 8 of the High Court\n(Civil Procedure) Rules of Lagos State, 1972. This procedure called \"registry judgment\" was how the respondent got\n106\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n112/145\njudgment in its favour. Meanwhile, the liquidator who had taken control of the United Commercial Bank Ltd. filed an appeal challenging the jurisdiction of the Lagos\nState High Court to entertain the matter by virtue of Section 230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution as amended by Decree No. 107 of 1993 which vests exclusive\njurisdiction in the Federal High Court to entertain certain actions between one bank and another.\nIt is sufficient on those facts to say, that the action was commenced in the High Court of Lagos State, and that the jurisdiction of the State High Court was challenged\nby the appellant as the contention of the appellant was that it was only the Federal High Court that had jurisdiction to entertain the issue. And as the appellant lost in\nthat challenge at the High Court, an appeal was lodged against the decision among others to the Court below. The issue raised before the Court below on this point\nreads thus:-\n\"Whether by virtue of Section 230(1)(d) of the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree No. 107 of 1993 a State High Court has any jurisdiction left to\nentertain any dispute between two banks relating the (sic) banking\n107\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n113/145\ntransactions.\"\nIn my humble view, a careful reading of that issue was clearly meant by the appellant as an invitation to the Court below to decide whether the Federal High Court was\nvested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine causes and matters with regard to a bank and its customers in the context of the case under consideration.\nThe Court of Appeal rightly took up the invitation and arrived at its decision on the question. Uwaifo, JCA in the course of his judgment said thus: -\n\"The mere fact that a bank takes an action against another bank does not make such action triable exclusively by the Federal High Court under Section 230(1)(d). It\nmust depend on the nature of the transaction and the capacity in which one of the banks dealt with the other. There is therefore, the need to examine such transaction\nand to look at the proviso which talks of transactions between an individual customer and his bank to ascertain its applicability. The point must be made that a section\nof a statute which contains a proviso must not be construed in such a way as to render the proviso unnecessary see R. v. Leeds Prison (Governor) ex parte Stafford\n108\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n114/145\n(1964) 1 ALL ER 610 at 612 per Lord Parker, C.J. But as a general rule, a proviso is of necessity limited in its operation to the ambit of the section which it qualifies: see\nLloyds & Scottish Finance Ltd. v. Modern Cars & Caravans (Kingston) Ltd. (1964) 2 ALL ER 732 at 740. So where a section confers powers, it would be contrary to the\nordinary operation of the proviso to give it an effect which would cut down those powers beyond what compliance with the proviso renders necessary. The object of a\nproviso is normally to cut down or qualify what has been stated before in a section. A proviso does not set out to allocate powers or jurisdiction or to impose\nlimitations or restrictions. Its function is to create exceptions or relax limitations in a defined sense, or to throw light on any ambiguous import in an enactment see Re\nTabrisky ex parte Board of Trade (1947) 2 ALL ER 182 at 183-184 per Lord Green, M. R. in West Derby Union v. Metropolitan Life Assurance Co. (1897) AC 647 at 652 per\nLord Watson. Section 230(1) of Decree No. 107 of 1993 must first be viewed from its import as I earlier pointed out, namely, to give\n109\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n115/145\nexclusive jurisdiction to the Federal High Court over causes affecting the vital interests of the Federal Government as regards revenue, fiscal measures, financial\ninstitutions, such as banks, the running of the Federal Government and its agencies and in matters within its exclusive list. A dispute between an individual customer\nand his bank in respect of transactions between them can hardly affect the vital interests of the federal government. So the proviso in Section 230(1)(d) relaxes in that\nregard the exclusive jurisdiction given to the Federal High Court.\"\nAnd later in his judgment at p. 756 he said:-\n\"It must however be realised that the horizon left for the State High Court under the proviso must not be shrunken into absurdity, or perhaps undue insignificance, by a\nrestrictive interpretation to oust its jurisdiction whenever two banks are involved, simply because they are banks. A bank is an individual legal entity. It can be an\nindividual customer to any other person when not acting as a bank. So it is that it can be an individual customer to a bank in any particular transaction depending on\nthe type of transaction. Therefore, a\n110\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n116/145\npossible scenario where one bank as an individual legal entity plays the part of an individual customer to another bank in a given transaction must be appreciated and\nnot ruled out. For instance, when one bank (say a Merchant Bank) renders service to another bank as an 'issuing house', any dispute arising from that transaction\nbetween the two banks must be heard in the Federal High Court. But if one bank as an individual is interested in earning interest from another bank through deposit,\nthen the relationship of individual customer and bank is established as in the present case. Any dispute arising from that transaction is triable in the State High Court\nas well as in the Federal High Court.\"\nNow earlier in this judgment, I had stated that this matter came before this Court as F.M.B.N. v. N.D.I.C. (supra). And in the course of the judgment delivered by\nOgundare, JSC (with which the others agreed) said thus: -\n\"It is contended for the plaintiff that the transaction between the plaintiff and the defendant leading to the action in the High Court of Lagos State was a dispute\nbetween an individual customer and his bank which is exempted\n111\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n117/145\nfrom the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court by the proviso in Section 230(1)(d). It is submitted that the plaintiff, in relation to that transaction, was an\nindividual customer to the defendant. Reliance on Bi Zee Bee Hotels Ltd. v. Allied Bank (Nig.) Ltd.(1996) 8 NWLR (Pt. 465) 176 at 185-186 G.A. I have considered the\narguments advanced by the parties, I agree entirely, with the reasoning of the Court below. With respect to the learned counsel for the respondent, I do not share the\nview that the proviso in Section 230(1)(d) would not apply where in a customer/banker relationship the customer is a bank. To say that where there is a dispute\nbetween two banks, the forum for the resolution of the dispute is the Federal High Court is to read into Section 230(1)(d) what is not there. A lot depends on the\nnature of the transaction between the two banks. The facts show that plaintiff, like any other customer, placed a short term deposit with the defendant on agreed\ninterest. After some roll-overs, plaintiff sought to retrieve its deposit and interest but defendant defaulted. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary about the\ncustom in the\n112\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n118/145\nindustry, I must hold that it is a simple customer/banker relationship which the proviso in Section 230(1)(d) exempts from the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High\nCourt.\"\nFrom what I have said above, I think it must respectfully be said that the judgment of the Supreme Court in this matter properly upheld the judgment of the Court\nbelow in that case per Uwaifo, JCA. It is manifest that the question that fell for consideration in the Court below, and which was further agitated in this Court arose\ndirectly from the question raised. Having said this much, I must add however, that the Court below in the present case ought to have followed and applied the decision\nof this Court in F.M.B.N. v. N.D.I.C. (supra). I will therefore set aside the decision of the Court below as it was a wrong appraisal of the facts before it which led to the\nwrong conclusion reached by it with regard to the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and the High Court of a State to entertain suits arising from transactions\nbetween a bank and its individual customers. For the avoidance of any doubt, I need to say that any dispute arising from that transaction\n113\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n119/145\nis triable in the State High Court as well as the Federal High Court.\nBefore concluding, it is pertinent to refer to the view held by the Court below on the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court vis-a-vis the State High Court with regard to\nthe provisions of Sections 3(1)(a) and 9 of Decree No. 18 of 1994 and Part 1 of the Schedule to Decree No. 62 of 1999 which amended Decree No. 18 of\n1994.Construing these several provisions, Oguntade, JCA, said thus: -\n\"It seems to me that in so far as jurisdiction in disputes between individual customer and the bank has been vested in State High Court, Sections 3(1) and 9 of the\nFailed Banks Decree as amended which vests jurisdiction on the same matters in the Federal High Court must be inconsistent with Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999\nConstitution which makes it void to the extent of the inconsistency. Appellant's counsel has submitted that enactments conferring jurisdiction on the Federal High\nCourt are existing laws which must be brought in conformity with the 1999 Constitution pursuant to Section 315 of the 1999 Constitution. I entirely agree with him.\"\nThe question that therefore falls for\n114\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n120/145\nconsideration is, whether the Court below was right to have declared void provisions of Sections 3(1) and 9 of Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended by Decree No. 62 of\n1999, Paragraph 7 of the Schedule thereto.\nNow Sections 3 (1)(a) and 9 of Decree No. 18 of 1994 read thus:-\n\"3(1) The Tribunal shall have power to\n(a) recover, in accordance with the provisions of this decree, the debts owed to a failed bank, arising in .the ordinary course of business and which remain outstanding\nas at the date the bank is closed or declared a failed bank by the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n9. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any law, deed, agreement or memorandum of understanding, the tribunal shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and\ndetermine all matters brought before it concerning the recovery from any person of any debt owed to a failed bank, which remains outstanding as at the date of\nclosure of the business of the failed bank.\"\nBy Paragraph 7 of Part 1 of the Schedule to Decree No. 62 of 1999, Decree No. 18 of 1994 was amended, inter alia, thus:-\n\"For the word 'Tribunal' wherever it appears in the Decree substitute the words\n115\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n121/145\n'Federal High Court.\"\nBy this piece of legislation, it is manifest that the Federal High Court was vested with the exclusive jurisdiction hitherto enjoyed by the Failed Bank Tribunals. That being\nthe position, there is the further question as to whether that exclusive jurisdiction granted to the Federal High Court is inconsistent to the extent of its being void with\nthe proviso to Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution and which read: -\n\"251(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an act of the\nNational Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters:\n(a) ...\n(b) ...\n(c) ...\n(d) connected with or pertaining to banking, banks, other financial institutions, any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the Central Bank of\nNigeria arising from banking, foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letters of credit, promissory notes and other fiscal measures.\nProvided that this\n116\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n122/145\nparagraph shall not apply to dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer and the bank.\"\nIn order to determine the question raised above, it is no doubt settled law that in order to interpret the provisions of any enactment, the Court seised of this duty, must\nfirst begin with the literal reading of the said provisions. And where the intention of the legislature was clear and unambiguous from the words used in the enactment,\nthen the act or the particular provisions must be interpreted accordingly. See Awolowo v. Shagari (1979) 6-9 SC 73; Nafiu Rabiu v. State (1980) 8-11 SC 130; Attorney-\nGeneral of Bendel State v. Attorney-General of the Federation (1982) 3 NCLR 1, (1981) 10 SC 1. With regard to the provisions of Section 251(1)(d) reproduced above, and\nwhich forms only a part of the provisions of the jurisdiction granted to the Federal High Court, it seems clear that the intention of the lawmakers was to vest the\nFederal High Court with exclusive jurisdiction in respect of matters which were considered within the purview of the federal government.\nBut it is also clear that\n117\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n123/145\nalthough by virtue of the proviso to Section 251(1)(d), the lawmakers delimited the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to hear and determine matters\nconnected with or pertaining to banking, banks, other financial institutions, including any action between one bank and another. In my view, the said proviso referred to\nabove did not affect the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court to continue hearing the matters identified in Section 251(1)(d). In the result, it is my view, that the Court\nbelow was wrong to have declared as void the provisions of Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended by Decree No. 62 of 1999.\nIt is therefore my view, that this appeal has merit and I will allow it for the above reasons and the fuller reasons given in the judgment of my learned brother, Uwaifo, JSC.\nI also abide by the orders made as to costs.\nDAHIRU MUSDAPHER, J.S.C.: I had the opportunity to read in draft the judgment of my learned brother Uwaifo, JSC and I am in entire agreement with it for the reasons\nhe has set out in detail. While I respectfully adopt those reasons as mine. I wish to briefly express my views in my own words.\nThe relevant\n118\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n124/145\nfacts have been briefly and succinctly stated in the leading judgment and I have no need to go over them. The important constitutional issue that has been addressed\nand in respect of which I wish to state my opinion is the interpretation to be given to Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution.\nFirst, let me refer to N.D.I.C. v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (1997) 2 NWLR (Pt. 490) 735, a decision of the Court of Appeal. That case interpreted Section 230(1)(d)\nof the 1979 Constitution as amended by Decree No. 107 of 1993. By the said amendment, the Federal High Court was given in clear language exclusive jurisdiction in a\nnumber of items with a proviso. It provided thus:\n\"230(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of the\nNational Assembly or a Decree, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court in civil causes and matters arising from\n(d) banking, bank, other financial institutions including any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the\n119\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n125/145\nCentral Bank of Nigeria arising from foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letter of credit, promissory note and other fiscal measures provided that\nthis paragraph shall not apply to any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer and the bank.\"\nThis provision has now been inserted in Section 251(1)(d) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999.\nGoing by the issues that arose for a decision in the Court of Appeal in that case of N.D.I.C. v. Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (supra), the Court over which I presided\ncame to the conclusion that the proviso was not intended to deprive the Federal High Court of jurisdiction but only of exclusive jurisdiction in disputes between the\nindividual customer and his bank in respect of transaction between the individual customer and the bank. That naturally meant that the State High Courts would\nexercise concurrent jurisdiction in such disputes. Put in other words, both the Federal High Court and the State High Courts would exercise concurrent jurisdiction as\nmay be appropriate.\nThe Court\n120\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n126/145\nof Appeal in the present case referred to that case and came to the conclusion per Oguntade, JCA that the pronouncement, that there was concurrent jurisdiction\nboth in the Federal High Court and the State High Courts was obiter. Mr. Clarke on his part has now also submitted before us on behalf of the respondent that the\npronouncement was an obiter dictum. I am convinced, that neither the Court below nor Mr. Clarke, with utmost respect, took pains to study that judgment in order to\nappreciate what led to the pronouncement. The relevant issue that was canvassed by both counsel in that case was, in essence, whether a State High Court still had\nany jurisdiction to exercise relating to banking transactions having regard to the provision of the said Section 230(1)(d). This called for a proper understanding and\ninterpretation of the effect of the proviso in that Section. The bank transaction in question happened to be that of individual customer and his bank.\nBut the submissions were polarized. One party argued that only the Federal High Court had jurisdiction; the other party argued it was only the State High Court. It was\nafter a careful consideration that the\n121\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n127/145\nCourt reached the decision that the Lagos State High Court in which the matter was indeed already pending, had jurisdiction to proceed with it. It was then also\nrelevant, in order to meet both arguments, to pronounce that the interpretation to be given to the provision was that the Federal High Court also could exercise\njurisdiction if such a matter was brought before it. I must hold, that the Court below was in grave error to have failed to regard that pronouncement as a ratio\ndecidendi in that case rather than as obiter.\nSecondly, it is plain to me that the Court below completely misconceived the rationale behind the decisions of this Court in Jammal Steel Structures Ltd. v. African\nContinental Bank Ltd. (1973) 1 ALL NLR (Pt. 2) 208 and Bronik Motors Ltd. v. Wema Bank Ltd. (1983) 1 SCNLR 296. As has been explained in the leading judgment, those\ndecisions were arrived at upon the ejusdem generis\u00a0interpretation of the word \"banking\" in Section 7(1)(b)(iii) of the Federal Revenue Court Decree, 1973/Federal\nHigh Court Act having regard to the wording in that Section which gave the Federal High Court jurisdiction in civil causes and matters\n122\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n128/145\nconnected with or pertaining to \"banking, foreign exchange, currency or other fiscal measures.\" This Court interpreted \"banking\" as used to mean, \"banking fiscal\nmeasures.\" It was this interpretation, which was not without controversy that limited the jurisdiction the Federal High Court could exercise in banking matters related to\nor connected with or involving in some way the Federal Government banking policy measures. But that has been altered by the wide and clear wording of Section\n251(1)(d) which gives exclusive jurisdiction to the Federal High Court in \"banking\" except where it involves individual customer and his bank transactions, in which case\nthe exclusiveness will not operate. This conclusion, can be derived from an appreciation of the functions of a proviso and the application of the one that is\u00a0reasonably\nappropriate. In the case of Section 251 (1)(d), the proviso does no more than relax the exclusive jurisdiction in banking that the Section, to which the proviso is\nappended, is understood to have conferred on the Federal High Court.\nFinally, having regard to the manner in which Section 251(1)(d) should be interpreted, particularly in\n123\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n129/145\nrespect of the effect of the proviso, Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended by Decree No. 62 of 1999, by which exclusive jurisdiction was conferred on the Federal High\nCourt on failed banks matters, must be brought into line with the 1999 Constitution. It must be realised that the original intention was to confine the jurisdiction over\nthe said matters to the tribunals set up by the Federal Military Government for that purpose. That same intention, was carried to the transfer of pending failed banks\nmatters to the Federal High Court. Ordinarily, that intention would have been given effect had the 1999 Constitution, made allowance for treating failed banks matters\nas special. But no such allowance has been made. Accordingly, the supremacy of the Constitution must hold sway over the decrees in question which now have only\nthe force of Acts of the National Assembly. The exclusive jurisdiction which the Federal High Court might have otherwise exercised in failed banks matters in regard to\nindividual customers and their banks transactions will now not be exclusive. It will simply exercise jurisdiction in deference to the proviso in Section 251(1)(d). The\nresult is that\n124\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n130/145\nthe State High Courts are also conferred with jurisdiction.\nFor the above reasons and those more fully stated by my learned brother Uwaifo, JSC, I allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court below. I abide by the\norders, including the order for costs, in the leading judgment.\nIGNATIUS CHUKWUDI PATS-ACHOLONU, J.S.C.: I have read the lead judgment of my learned brother Uwaifo, JSC and I agree with him. I will however add a few comments\nof mine. Prior to the coming into effect of the present Nigerian Constitution in 1999, the appellant had instituted an action against the respondents pursuant to the\nprovision of Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended by the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and\nFinancial Malpractices in Banks Amendment\u00a0Decree of 1995 in the Financial Malpractices in Banks Tribunal claiming from them as follows:-\n\"(i) The sum of N284,109,459.59 being the outstanding balance on the loan/overdraft facilities granted by the bank to the respondents as at 31st January, 1999.\n(ii) Interest at the rate of 21% per annum from 1st February, 1999 until\n125\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n131/145\nfinal liquidation\" .\nTo the claim for the recovery of the alleged indebtedness, the respondents denied any debt to the appellant. However, before the commencement of the trial, a new\nlaw described as Tribunals (Certain Consequential Amendments etc.) Decree No. 62 of 1999 came into effect and the jurisdiction of the Failed Banks Tribunals was\ntransferred to the Federal High Court. The new Constitution, which came into force on 29th May, 1999 made provision for the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court in\nthis regard.\nThe respondents had contended that the Federal High Court by the provision of Section 251(1)(d) of the Constitution has no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the matter\nbefore it on the transaction arguing that the contract was no more than the customer and bank relationship. They urged the Court to strike out the matter. The trial\nCourt dismissed the objection and the respondents appealed to the Court of Appeal which after examining the case thoroughly, allowed the appeal. Insensed or irked\nby the stand of the Court of Appeal the appellant appealed to this Court.\nMeanwhile the respondents further filed a notice of preliminary\n126\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n132/145\nobjection urging the Court to strike out ground 4 of the notice of appeal and the issue based on it. The appellant framed 4 issues for determination by this Court and\nthey are as follows:-\n\"1. Whether the Court below, was right when it restricted itself to the provisions of Decree No 107 of 1993 and Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution in\nconsidering whether the position of the law as regards the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and State High Court in respect of transaction between individual\ncustomers and their bank had been altered since the time of the 1979 Constitution.\n2. Whether Sections 3(1) and 9 of the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Decree No. 18 of 1994 (as amended by Decree No. 62\nof 1999) are inconsistent with Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and are therefore unconstitutional, null and void.\n3. Whether the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria conferred exclusive jurisdiction in \"disputes between an individual customer and his bank\" on\nthe State High Courts.\n4. Whether the suit instituted by the appellant against the\n127\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n133/145\nrespondents herein, does not qualify as a suit involving \"other fiscal measures\" (within the meaning of Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution) in which the Federal\nGovernment is interested as considered in previous decision of this Honourable Court.\"\nThe reply brief of the appellants, is really no answer to the objection of the respondents in the preliminary objection. The respondents, however framed 4 issues for\nconsideration by this Court. I hereby set them down as follows:-\n\"(i) Whether the Court below restricted itself to the provisions of Section 230( 1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution as amended by Decree No 107 of 1993 and Section\n251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution in considering whether the position of the law as regards the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court and State High Courts in respect\nof transactions between individual customers and their banks had been altered since the time of the 1979 Constitution.\n(ii) Whether the Court below, was right in its decision that in disputes between an individual customer and his bank, only a State High Court has jurisdiction by virtue of\nthe proviso to Section 251(1)(d) of the Constitution.\n128\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n134/145\n(iii) Whether the Court below, was right in its decision that in so far as jurisdiction between an individual customer and his bank has been vested in State High Courts,\nSections 3(1) and 9 of the Failed Banks Decree which purports to vest jurisdiction on same matters in the Federal High Court are inconsistent with the proviso to\nSection 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution.\n(iv) Whether the suit instituted by the appellant against the respondents herein qualified as a suit involving \"other fiscal measures\" within the meaning of Section 251(1)\n(d) of the 1999 Constitution.\"\nThe parties contention in the case before this Court, is essentially built on the ramification of Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution. In the argument to the\ncontents of the issues framed, the appellant submitted, that it cannot be the correct interpretation of Section 230(1)(d) of the 1979 Constitution as amended by\nDecree No. 107 of 1993 when compared with Section 251(1)(d) of the 1999 Constitution in respect of the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court that the constitution\nhas divested the Federal High Court of the jurisdiction it hitherto enjoyed in the nature of the case\n129\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n135/145\nbefore this Court, arguing that the correct interpretation of Sections 3(1) and 9 of the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Decree\n(as amended by the Decree No. 62 of 1999) is that the Decree vested exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine its claims against the respondents in the Federal\nHigh Court. Now the approach of the lower Court to this seemingly naughty and intractable problem as to where the jurisdiction of the Court lies is to have a historical\nover view or perspective of the powers of the Federal High Court before the present constitution. For this the Court below, sought to show the historical sequence of\nevents which predated both the original Failed Bank Decree of 1994 and the amendments made in 1999 to wit Decree No. 62 of 1999 and also the Constitution by\ngoing back to the provision of the law in respect of vesting of powers of adjudication in Federal High Court in a subject matter relating to banking. Strictly speaking,\nnotwithstanding any provision contained in Sections 3(1) and 9 of the Failed Banks Decree (as amended by Decree No. 62 of 1999), Section 251(1)(d) of the\nConstitution shall be the operative\n130\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n136/145\nlaw for this Court to rely to discover and understand to which Court the subject matter in this case would have the jurisdiction. The appellant is of the view that relying\non the case of Ibrahim v. J.SC. (1998) 12 S.C. at 35; Rheinmass v. Railway Lines Ltd. (1998) 4 S.C. 73 at 82 - 83 and also Savannah Bank v. Ajilo (1998) 14 NWLR (Pt. 584) 1,\n(1989) 1 NWLR (Pt. 97) 305, (1989) 1 S. C. (Pt. 11) 90 at 106 it is incontestable, that a careful consideration of Decree No. 107 of 1993 read along doing with Decree No. 62\nof 1999 can be said to have vested the Federal High Court with the same powers. A holistic approach, to the controversy would readily show that this Court is being\ncalled upon to determine whether by reason of Section 251(1)(d) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the proviso contained in that Section, can be\nsaid to have made any significant alteration to the jurisdictional preserve of the Federal High Court. In other words which Court has the jurisdiction in a matter relating\nto Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts Act), the Federal High Court exercising an exclusive jurisdiction or, a State High Court only exercising exclusive\n131\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n137/145\njurisdiction or both having regard to the proviso attached to Section 251(1)(d). The nature of this case, reminds one that a mere simplistic approach to what is\nobviously a complex issue would definitely mire the quest to give a well considered juridical approach to a matter of great importance in the realms of the\njurisprudence in relation to recovery of debts.\nWhat indeed are the ramifications of the contents and intendment of Section 251(1)(d) (supra). Before delving into the nuances of this matter let me first set down the\nprovision of that Section;\n(i)\"251.(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Constitution and in addition to such other jurisdiction as may be conferred upon it by an Act of\nthe National Assembly, the Federal High Court shall have and exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court, in civil causes and matters -\n(d) Connected with or pertaining to banking, banks other financial institutions, including any action between one bank and another, any action by or against the Central\nBank of Nigeria arising from banking, foreign exchange, coinage, legal tender, bills of exchange, letters of credit,\n132\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n138/145\npromissory notes and other fiscal measures:\nProvided that this Paragraph, shall not apply to any dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of transactions between the individual customer\nand the bank.\"\nBy the provision in this Section, the primary law is stating that the preserve of the Federal High Court in respect of matters contained in Sub-Section (d) above vests\nsquarely and unadulterated in the Federal High Court before the proviso. The proviso to the law then however can be interpreted to say that the exclusiveness of the\npower so stated above shall not apply in a dispute between an individual customer and his bank in respect of any banking transaction. Who is a customer of a bank,\nBlack's Law Dictionary defines the term in relation to banking as any person having an account with a bank or for whom a bank has agreed to collect items and\nincludes a bank carrying an account with another bank. The learned counsel for the appellant argued, that it would seem that the exclusivity intended by Section 251(1)\n(d)\u00a0has by virtue of the ubiquitous proviso clause been whittled down. To the respondents obviously basking on the\n133\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n139/145\njudgment of the Court of Appeal and construing the proviso to mean that only the State High Court can exercise jurisdiction in such a matter, they argued that the\nproviso should be construed to mean that the Federal High Court has been divested of its power hitherto vested on it first by Decree No. 107 of 1993, and by Failed\nBanks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial Malpractices in Banks Decree No. 18 of 1994 as amended and by the Failed Banks (Recovery of Debts) and Financial\nMalpractices in Banks Amendment Decree of 1995. It is important for us to understand the under belly of the term \"proviso\" when used in a statute. In Abasi v. The\nState (1992) 8 NWLR (Pt. 260) 383, 403 this Court held that:-\n\"It is a well recognized principle of the interpretation of statutes that a proviso is an exception to the main rule. The object of a proviso in a statutory enactment is to\nqualify or cut down the enacting clause which precedes it. In reality, it is used as an exception to the main rule. See Eme v. State (1964) 1 ALL NLR 416. Where the words\nof a section are capable of showing more than one meaning the proviso will show the proper meaning to be\n134\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n140/145\nattached to it. See Anyah v. State (1965) NMLR 62\".\nTo my mind, the approach of the respondents id est, their understanding and construction of the intendment by the proviso is skewed and constricted. Provisos in\nenactments are meant to serve as a special exemption from the general run of things. In other words, the essence of a proviso in an enactment is to remove or isolate,\nlimit or modify certain matters from the general operations of the law vesting some powers or enacting or establishing some features intended to be provided or\nprescribed by the enactment. See Saginaw County Tp. Officers Association v. City of Saginaw 373 Mich. 477, 130, 130 N.W. 2nd 30, 32. It was held in Stoler v. State 171\nNeb. 93, 105 N.W. 2nd 852 at 856 that a proviso is a clause engrafted on a preceding enactment for the purpose of restraining or modifying the enacting clause or of\nexcepting something from its operation which would otherwise have been within it. In effect, the proviso in Section 251(1)(d)\u00a0 is to limit the operationality of the\nforegoing prescription to show that applicability is not general but it does not destroy or divest the Federal High\n135\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n141/145\nCourt of this power. It should therefore, be understood to mean that the exclusivity it enjoyed has been broken and in this case, can only mean that the Federal High\nCourt enjoys equal power with the State High Court in banking cases involving bank and customer. In Lloyds and Scottish Finance Ltd. v. Modern Cars & Caravans\n(Kingston) Ltd. (1966) 1 QB 764 - at 781 the Court had to consider the import of provisos in a statute. By Section 26(1) of the Sale of Goods Act, 1893, it was provided\nthat a writ of execution against goods\" bind the property in the goods of the execution debtor as from the time when the writ is delivered to the sheriff to be executed;\n... Provided that no such writ shall prejudice the title to such goods acquired by any person in good faith and for valuable consideration, unless such person had at the\ntime when he acquired his title noticed that such writ or any other writ by virtue of which the goods of the execution debtor might be seized or attached had been\ndelivered to and remained unexecuted in the hands of the sheriff.\" In its construction of the tenor and intendment of the proviso, the Court held that;\n\"The proviso,\n136\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n142/145\naccordingly, does no more than protect a purchaser of the goods against that right of seizure, if the stated conditions are fulfilled .... It has no scope for operation where\nan actual seizure of the debtor's goods has already been effected; and where this has occurred, it is immaterial whether or not the purchaser from the debtor had\nnotice of the seizure, or even of the writ.\"\nIn the old case of Attorney-General v. Chelsea Waterworks Co. (1731) Fitzg. 195 it was held, that if a proviso cannot reasonably be construed otherwise than as\ncontradicting the main enactment, then the proviso will prevail on the principle that it speaks the last intention of the law makers. In the present case, the exclusiveness\nin the vesting of powers of adjudication conferred on the Federal High Court in the older acts has been diluted to include and confer jurisdiction on the State High\nCourt in this sort of case. It must be admitted, and this Court takes judicial notice of the fact that banks and State High Courts are spread all over the country. It is\npossible, that the framers of the constitution might have conceived and contended in their collective wisdom that the\n137\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n143/145\nFederal Courts mostly located in urban areas are not as extended as the State High Courts. Therefore, to meet the needs of litigants in regard to intention of cases of\nthe nature under consideration, it shall be considered more practicable or pragmatic to spread the jurisdiction more widely to deal with banking matters arising in the\nless fanciful locations. The sum total of what I am saying is that, by the proviso both the Federal High Court and the State High Court exercise concurrent jurisdiction in\nthis area.\nAccordingly, I allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the Court below and restore the judgment of the High Court. I abide by the consequential orders made in\nthe lead judgment.\nAppeal allowed.\n138\n5/8/25, 10:54 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n144/145\nAlhaji Abdullahi Ibrahim, SAN (with him, Rickey Tarfa, SAN, Akinola Ama, Esq., O.\nO.

Indeed all the authorities are the other way. In the area where rule of law operates, the rule of self help by force is abandoned. Nigeria being\none of the countries in the world even in the third world which proclaim loudly to follow the rule of law, there is no room for the rule of self help by force to\noperate. Once a dispute has arisen between a person and the government or authority and the dispute has been brought before the Court, thereby\ninvoking the judicial powers of the state. It is the duty of the government to allow the law to take its course or allow the legal and judicial process to run its\nfull course.\"\nEQUITABLE REMEDY - INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTIONS - Guiding principles for the grant of interim injunction\n\"The principles for the grant of interim injunction have been settled in decisions of the Courts in this country and in England. See-American Cyanamid vs.\nEthicon Ltd. (1975) A.C. 396; Egbe vs Onogun (1972) 1 All N.L.R. Pt. 195,98. In Kufeji v. Kogbe 1961 1 All N.L.R.113, 114 Coker, J.(as he then was) set the test which\nhas been accepted these years. He said- \"In an application for interim relief by way of injunction, it is not necessary that a plaintiff or applicant should make\nout a case as he would on the merits, it being sufficient that he should establish that there is a substantial issue to be tried at the hearing\"\nEQUITABLE REMEDY - INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTIONS - Principles governing the grant or refusal of an application for interlocutory\ninjunction\n\"What are the principles governing the grant of an interlocutory injunction? The governing principles are fairly well settled although the statement and\nrestatement of the principles has in some cases been in terms which have created confusion. This was clearly stated by Lord Diplock in the case of\nAmerican Cyanamid v. Ethicon Limited (a House of Lords English case) (1975) AC. 396 at 407 which reads: \"The court, however, expressly deprecated any\nattempt to fetter the discretion of the court by laying down any rule which would have the effect of limiting the flexibility of the remedy as a means of\nachieving the objects I have indicated above. Nevertheless, this authority was treated by Graham J. and the Court of Appeal in the instant appeal as leaving\nintact the supposed rule that the court is not entitled to take account of the balance of convenience unless it has first been satisfied that if the case went\nto trial upon no other evidence than is before the court at the hearing of the application the plaintiff would be entitled to judgment for a permanent\ninjunction in the same terms as the interlocutory injunction sought. Your Lordships should in my view take this opportunity of declaring that there is no\nsuch rule. The use of such expression as \"a probability\", \"a prima facie case\", or \"a strong prima facie case\" in the context of the exercise of a discretionary\npower to grant an interlocutory injunction leads to confusion as to the object sought to be achieved by this form of temporary relief. The court no doubt\nmust be satisfied that the claim is not frivolous or vexatious; in other words, that there is a serious question to be tried. It is not part of the court's function\nat this stage of the litigation to try to resolve conflicts of evidence on affidavit as to facts on which the claims of either party may ultimately depend nor to\ndecide difficult questions of law which call for detailed argument and mature consideration. These are matters to be dealt with at the trial.\" When an\napplication for an interlocutory injunction to restrain a defendant from doing acts alleged to be a violation of the plaintiff's legal right is made upon\ncontested facts, the decision whether or not to grant an interlocutory injunction has to be taken at a time when ex hypothesis, the existence of the right or\nthe violation of it or both is uncertain and will remain uncertain until final judgment is given in the action. It was to mitigate the risk of injustice to the\nplaintiff during the period the uncertainty could be resolved that the practice arose of granting him relief by way of interlocutory injunction. However, since\nthe middle of 19th century this has been made subject to his undertaking to pay damages to the defendant for any loss sustained by reason of the\ninjunction if it should he heard at the trial that the plaintiff had not been entitled to restrain the defendant from doing what he was threatening to do. The\nobject of interlocutory injunction is to protect the plaintiff against injury by violation of his right for which he could not be adequately compensated in\ndamages recoverable in the action if the uncertainty were resolved in his favour at the trial; but the plaintiff's need for such protection must be weighed\nagainst the corresponding need of the defendant to be protected against injury resulting from his having been prevented exercising his own legal rights for\nwhich he could not be adequately compensated under the plaintiff's undertaking in damages if the uncertainty wee resolved in the defendant's favour at\nthe trial. The court must weigh one need against another and determine where the \"balance of evidence lies.\" It could be seen that the High Court and the\nCourt of Appeal surrendered their discretion to the vagaries of ascertaining from affidavit evidence conclusive proof of proprietary or occupational rights\nat this early stage. In cases where the legal rights of the parties depend upon facts that are in dispute between them, as in the instant appeal, the evidence\navailable to the Court at the hearing of the application for an interlocutory injunction is incomplete.\"\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/52\nEQUITABLE REMEDY - INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTIONS - Whether proprietary interest in a property needs to be proved in an application\nfor interim relief\n\"It has, however, been held that in an application for interim relief it is not necessary to prove proprietary interest in the property to be protected. All that\nseems to be needed is proof of lawful occupation with authority of owner. Ojukwu v. Governor of Lagos State (1986) 3 N.W.L.R. 39: Agbor v. Metropolitan\nPolice Commissioner (1969) 1 W.L.R. 703.\"\nEQUITABLE REMEDY - INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTIONS - Principles governing the grant or refusal of an application for interlocutory\ninjunction\n\"In Abel O. Woluchem v. Dr. Charles Inko Tariah Wokoma (1974) 3-5 SC. 153 at 156, Ibekwe, J.S.C. delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court stated the\nrule thus: \"The rule is that a plaintiff seeking an interlocutory injunction must establish a strong prima facie case for the existence of his right and at least\nthat he was likely to succeed on that issue and also a prima facie case of infringement of his right. In exercising its discretion to grant the relief, the Court\nwould have regard to the balance of convenience.\" Then he went on to comment: \"We fail to see how a Court of law could be able to satisfy all or any of\nthese principles before pleadings were filed and without evaluating some sort of evidence (be it oral or affidavit evidence by both parties).\" Another case\nworthy of mention in this regard is Ladunni v. Kukoyi & Ors (1972) 1 ALL NLR (Part 1) 133. Explaining the principle, Coker, J.S.C. delivering the judgment of the\nCourt, said at page 138: \"The principle seems to us to be clear and in short, an interim injunction would be granted to a party who shows that he has a prima\nfacie case on a claim of right or in other words that, prima facie, the case he has made out is one which the opposing party would be called upon to answer\nand that it is just and convenient to the Court to intervene and that unless the Court so intervenes at that stage, the other party's action or conduct would\nirreparably alter the status quo or render ineffective any subsequent decree of the Court.\" The Court had earlier at page 137 adopted with approval the\ndictum of Ungoed-Thomas, J. in Donmar Production Ltd. v. Bart and Ors (1967) 1 WLR 740 at 742 with respect to this point which reads: \"So in an application\nfor an interlocutory injunction, the applicant must establish a probability or a strong prima facie case that he is entitled to the right of whose violation he\ncomplains and, subject to this being established, the governing consideration is the maintenance of the status quo pending the trial.\"\nEQUITABLE REMEDY - INTERLOCUTORY/INTERIM INJUNCTIONS - Whether the court ought to consider the balance of convenience in granting or\nrefusing an injunction\n\"...It is well established that in deciding whether the matter shall be maintained in status quo, regard must be had to the balance of convenience and to the\nextent to which any damage to the plaintiffs can be cured by payment of damages rather than by the granting of injunction. Of course the burden of proof\nlies on the applicant throughout.\" Of this statement, Coker, JSC, said at p. 137: \"we think this is a correct proposition of the law and we propose to apply it to\nthe case in hand.\"\nPRACTICE AND PROCEDURE - APPLICATION FOR INJUNCTION - Whether the court must be satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried\nbefore the grant of an interlocutory injunction\n\"...The learned trial Judge, whose decision came to the Supreme Court on appeal and was affirmed, stating the principle which guided him, said \"....The\nprinciple on which the Court will act in an application for an order of interlocutory injunction is well settled and it is that the Court should be satisfied that\nthere is a serious question to be tried at the hearing and that on the facts before it, there is a probability that the plaintiff is entitled to relief.\" This principle\nis almost a restatement of the dictum of Lord Diplock in American Cyanamid v. Ethicon Ltd. (Supra). The point appears to have been more correctly stated\nby this Court in Egbe v. Onogun (1972) 1 All NLR, 95 at 98, when it said: \"In Kufeji v. Kogbe (1961) All NLR 113 which deals with the practice and procedure\ngoverning applications for interim injunctions, Coker J. (as he then was) stated at page 114 'In an application for interim relief by way of injunction, it is not\nnecessary that a plaintiff or applicant should make out a case as he would do on the merits, it being sufficient that he should establish that there is a\nsubstantial issue to be tried at the hearing...' In a case of interim injunction, it is not necessary to determine the legal right to a claim since at that stage, as\nit is in this case, there can be no such determination; because pleadings have not been filed, no issue joined, and no oral evidence adduced; therefore there\ncannot be any finding on the merits.\"\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n4/52\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - RULE OF LAW - Whether the courts will permit an unlawful invasion of a person's properties as the guardians of the rule\nof law\n\"A Nigerian citizen and indeed any Nigerian Company as a Corporate body in lawful possession of their properties are entitled to protection of those\nproperties under our Constitution; and until they are proved not to be entitled, the Courts as guardians of the Rule of Law will frown at any unlawful invasion\nof such properties by anyone no matter how highly placed. That point was made clear in the case of the Military Governor of Lagos State & Ors v. Chief\nEmeka O. Ojukwu & Anor (supra).\"\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - RULE OF LAW - What the rule of law entails\n\"...The Nigerian Constitution is founded on the rule of law, the primary meaning of which is that every thing must be done according to law. It means also\nthat government should be conducted within the frame-work of recognised rules and principles which restrict discretionary power, which Coke colourfully\nspoke of as 'golden and straight network of law as opposed to the uncertain and crooked cord of discretion' (see 4 Inst. 41). More relevant to the case in\nhand, the rule of law means that disputes as to the legality of acts of government are to be decided by Judges who are wholly independent of the\nexecutive. See Wade on Administrative Law 5th Edition p.22-27. That is the position in this country where the judiciary has been made independent of the\nexecutive by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1979 as amended by Decree No.1 of 1984 and No. 17 of 1985. The judiciary cannot shirk its\nsacred responsibility to the nation to maintain the rule of law. It is both in the interest of the government and all persons in Nigeria. The law should be even-\nhanded between the government and citizens.\"\nJUDGEMENT SUMMARY\nINTRODUCTION:\nThis appeal borders on Civil procedure.\nFACTS:\nThe appellant instituted the present action at the High Court of Benue State holden at Makurdi against the Respondents. After instituting the action, the\nPlaintiff/Appellant then applied to the Court for:\n\"(a) An order restraining all the officers and men of the Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Airforce by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwise from preventing\nthe plaintiff from obtaining access to and occupying the premises known as Obeya Memorial Hospital Ayi-Onyema Family Ltd.\u00a0\n(b) An Order requiring the Federal Government and or the Benue State Government to restore possession of the said premises to the Plaintiff.\n(c) An Order restraining the Federal Government and/or Benue State Government by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwise from delivering possession of\nthe said premises to any person other than the Plaintiff or it's duly authorized agents pending the determination of the above action and for such further and or other\norders as the Court may deem fit.\"\nThere were two affidavits in support of the application, one was by John Ede a director of the appellant company who deposed that at all material times to the action\nthe Plaintiff/Appellant was in occupation of the buildings in Oturkpo Local Government Area Benue State which buildings are used for the purposes of a Hospital known\nas Obeya Memorial Specialist Hospital and that on the 24th of January 1986 some 30 Nigerian Army personnel and about 10 Nigerian Airforce personnel all armed\nentered the land and buildings used for the purposes of the hospital, and effectively took possession of the same.\nChief Obande Obeya also swore to another affidavit to show that the appellant was in occupation of the premises as a licensee of Obeya Memorial Hospital. The\nlearned Chief Judge dismissed the application holding that it had not been shown that the Applicant was in occupation of the land. The Plaintiff/Appellant appealed to\nthe Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal also dismissed the application by confirming the decision of the trial Chief Judge. The Court also held that the\nPlaintiff/Appellant not having shown that it was in occupation of the premises, it has failed to make out a strong prima facie case for the grant of the interlocutory\ninjunction. The Appellant therefore appealed to the Supreme Court.\nISSUES:\nThe Supreme Court, determined the appeal on the issues raised by both parties.\nThe Appellant raised the following issues:\n\"(i) What are the quality and quantity of the evidence which the plaintiff was required to establish in the High Court to support its\u00a0 application for interlocutory\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n5/52\ninjunction?\n(ii) Were the affidavit evidence of John Ede and Obeya of the quality and quantity so required?\"\nThe 2nd Respondent also raised the following issue:\n\"Whether or not on the affidavit evidence before the Court, the trial Court and the Court of Appeal were justified in holding that the appellant had not established a\nstrong prima facie case to entitle it to injunction.\"\nDECISION/HELD:\nIn the final analysis, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal and the decisions of the Court of Appeal and the High Court were set aside.\nANDREWS OTUTU OBASEKI, J.S.C.:\n(Delivering the Leading\u00a0Judgment):\nThis is an interlocutory appeal. The\nPlaintiffs/Appellants instituted an action against the\nrespondents in the Benue State High Court of\nJustice at Makurdi, claiming:\n(1) a declaration that the entry of the land and\nbuildings of the Obeya Memorial Specialist Hospital\nOturkpo Town in Oturkpo Local Government Area\nby Army and Airforce personnel as well as by\nofficers and servants of the Government of Benue\nState was unlawful and amounts to trespass;\n(2) a declaration that the Government of Benue\nState has no right to take or retain possession of\nthe said land and buildings from the plaintiff save\nin accordance with due process of law;\n(3) an order for inquiry into damages suffered by\nthe plaintiff as a result of the unlawful entry on the\nsaid land and buildings (a) by Nigerian Army and\n(b) by Nigerian Air force personnel;\n7\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n6/52\n(4) an order for inquiry into damages suffered by\nthe plaintiff as a result of the trespass committed\nby the Benue State Government on the plaintiff's\ngoods as well as on the said land and buildings;\n(5) an order for payment of appropriate sums as\ncompensatory and/or exemplary damages to the\nplaintiff for the acts of trespass aforementioned;\u00a0and\n(6) an injunction restraining all officers of the\nNigerian Army and Airforce and all officers.\nservants and agents of the Benue State\nGovernment from continuing the said acts of\ntrespass or committing further acts of trespass or\nfrom preventing the plaintiff, its officers, servants\nand licensees from obtaining access to the land and\nbuildings used for the purposes of the Obeya\nMemorial Specialist Hospital.\"\nThe appellants followed the filing of the action with\nan application by motion on notice for:\n\"(1) An order restraining all the officers and men of\nthe Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Air Force by\nthemselves, their servants or agents or otherwise\nfrom preventing the plaintiffs from obtaining access\nto and occupying the premises known as Obeya\nMemorial Specialist Hospital Ayi-Onyema Family\nLimited;\n(2) An order requiring the Federal Government\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n7/52\nand/or the Benue State Government to restore\npossession of the said premises to the plaintiffs;\n(3) An order restraining the Federal Government\nand/or Benue State Government by themselves,\ntheir servants or agents or otherwise from\n8\ndelivering possession of the said premises to any\nperson other than the plaintiffs or its duly\nauthorized agents; pending the determination of\nthe above action and for such further and or other\norders as this Honourable Court may deem fit to\nmake in the circumstances.\nThe application was heard by the Chief Judge of\nBenue State, Alhassan Idoko, and on the 7th day of\nMay, 1986, he dismissed the application in a\nconsidered Ruling. In the course of his Ruling, the\nlearned Chief Judge made a lot of pronouncements\nwhich are not reflected by the order of dismissal.\nHe said:\n\"I am bound by the opinion of the Supreme Court\nthat even in this military regime, the rule of law is\nin operation that no government in the Federation\nshould put (sic) (take) Law into its hand as that will\nbe an encouragement to tyranny. No\u00a0Court of law\nwill rejoice at a usurpation of its powers................\n...........................................................................\nI am not too sure whether the\u00a0Courts can gloss over\na provision of a statute such as the Edict\nestablishing this panel even that the contents or\nconstitutionality of it avail when such issues are\nraised. In that wise, I am not prepared to say that a\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/52\ncase of usurpation of judicial powers has been\nmade out. I agree that it might have raised\neye-brows that military men were brought to\nensure the take over of the hospital through the\naction of the military government. The affidavit\nevidence says that it is this Recovery Panel that\napproached the Governor to (sic) that purpose. I\nthink that is entirely wrong.......We have never\n9\nknown a Governor or military personnel enforcing\nthe judgment of a tribunal or panel. So that the\nbringing of military personnel and not the police to\nexecute the panel's order is entirely out of tune\nwith the usual and normal way of enforcing such\norders ....... Even though the facts disclose that the\npanel contacted the Governor for such\nenforcement, it is all wrong, because the Governor\nis not the proper official to be approached to carry\nout such enforcement. It was only because the\npanel was intent on using military personnel that it\nmade that move. That notwithstanding, the panel\npurported to enforce an order that fell within its\npowers. So that even though the use of military\npersonnel is condemnable, the take-over itself is\nsaid to be pursuant to an order of the panel ... For\nthe time being, I am prepared to say that the\ngovernment has furnished some basis in the\naffidavit evidence for taking over the hospital.\nGovernment says it does not know the applicant\nand that the hospital it has taken over belongs to\nObande Obeya and also that it was Obande Obeya\nwho was in occupation and possession of the land\nand the building housing the hospital; that Obande\nwas indebted to it and that since Mr. Obeya was not\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/52\nresponding to the panel's demands to pay up\nindebtedness to government, his property, the\nhospital was seized. Obande is not complaining in\nthis matter but the applicant. Was there a mistaken\nidentity as to who owns or was in possession of the\nhospital? Applicant said they are licencee of Obeya\nMemorial Hospital. Obeya Memorial Hospital is\n10\nowned by Obande and Sons. The period when the\nlicence took effect is not yet disclosed. And even\nthough there is a hospital mentioned as Obeya\nMemorial Specialist Hospital, it is not yet disclosed\nwhether it is registered as a private hospital under\nthe prevailing law of the State and by who. On the\nface of these facts, it appears not, to me prudent to\ngrant this equitable relief to the applicant.\"\nThe appellant was dissatisfied with the ruling and\nappealed to the Court of Appeal on four grounds.\nThe grounds were:\n(1) The learned Chief Judge erred in law in failing\nto observe that at the stage at which the\nproceedings stood when he gave the decision\nappealed from, he was not called upon to determine\nany of the controversial issues of law and fact\nwhich arise between the parties and which require\nfurther oral and documentary evidence and\naddresses before theCourt can properly determine\nthe issue.\n(2) The learned trial Judge erred in law and on the\nfacts in failing to observe that it was improper for\nhim to give consideration to various issues of fact\nand law not raised by counsel for the defendant,\nwithout giving opportunity to the plaintiffs' counsel\nto address him on such issues;\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n10/52\n(3) The learned Chief Judge erred in raising a doubt\nas to whether the plaintiff was in occupation of the\npremises when no such doubt was expressed by the\ndefendant;\n(4) The learned Chief Judge erred in law in making\nfinding that \"the government has furnished some\n11\nbasis in the affidavit evidence for taking over the\nhospital.\"\nParticulars of Error\n(a) If (which is not conceded) it is the case that\nObande Obeya is the owner of the hospital, it was\nimproper for the learned Chief Judge to make the\nfinding when Obande Obeya was not represented as\na party to the proceedings;\n(b) The affidavit of Obande shows clearly that the\nperson in possession of the buildings housing the\nhospital is the plaintiff company and the application\nfor mandatory injunction ought to have been\nconsidered on the basis of that allegation;\n(5) The learned Chief Judge erred in law in failing\nto observe that the defendants having virtually\nadmitted that it took possession vi et armis, he\nought to have ordered them to restore possession\nto the plaintiff herein.\nThe appeal came up for hearing before the Court of\nAppeal (Coram, Agbaje, Abdullahi and Macaulay,\nJJCA.) Jos. Again, the applicant was unsuccessful as\nthe Court in a considered judgment, dismissed it.\nIn his judgment (concurred in by Abdullahi and\nMacaulay, JJCA.) Agbaje, JCA, commented in the\nconcluding paragraphs as follows:\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n11/52\n\"If I may go back to the case of Agbor v.\nMetropolitan Police Commission, (supra) the\npossession of the plaintiff in the case prior to the\nwrong they complained of were not in dispute and\nin fact there was evidence that Mrs. Agbor occupied\nthe house in dispute in the case with her children\nfor some six months before she was ejected.\n12\nApart from the averments in the affidavits of the\nplaintiff, as to its being in occupation of the hospital\nin question, there is no evidence from the plaintiff\nin support of this averment.\nTruly enough, paragraph 4 of the affidavit of\nObande Obeya says that the plaintiff is in\noccupation of the land and the buildings housing\nthe Obeya Memorial Hospital with the authority and\nas a licensee of Obeya Memorial Hospital. Obeya\nMemorial Hospital is an unincorporated association.\nAs I have said, it is owned by members of Obeya\nfamily. One would have expected in an application\nof this nature, some evidence as to when and how\nmembers of Obeya family passed any interest in\nthe hospital to the plaintiff before one can come to\nthe conclusion that the plaintiff has made good his\nassertion that he is in occupation of the hospital\nwith the licence of the owners thereof.\nAgain, if these were not so, one would have\nexpected the plaintiff, in its affidavit before the\nCourt, to show what acts it relies upon as\nconstituting its occupation or possession of the\nhospital in question. The affidavit for the plaintiff\nin support of its application is deficient in these\ntwo particulars which I have just highlighted. If I\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/52\nmay put it in another way, the affidavit for the\nplaintiff alleges occupation or possession of the\npremises to which the reliefs sought in the\ninterlocutory application relate. But the affidavit\ndoes not go on to state the acts of occupation or\npossession by the plaintiff from which the inference\nmay be drawn that the plaintiff was actually in\n13\npossession or occupation of the premises.\nIn the circumstances, I cannot hold that on the\nmaterial placed before the lower\u00a0Court, the latter\nshould have been satisfied that the plaintiff has\nmade out a strong prima facie case that it was in\npossession of the premises, the subject matter of\nthe interlocutory application, before the wrong it\ncomplained of.\nFor the reasons I have given in this judgment, I\ncannot therefore say that the learned trial Chief\nJudge was wrong in refusing the interlocutory\napplication.\"\nThe appellant was not still satisfied and therefore\nlodged an appeal against the decision of the Court\nof Appeal to this Court on three grounds of appeal\nwhich read:\n1. The\u00a0Court below erred and misdirected itself in\nlaw in applying to the facts and circumstances of\nthis case what it described as \"the age long\nrequirements that in an application for an\ninterlocutory injunction, the applicant, to succeed,\nmust establish a probability or a strong prima facie\n(case) that he is entitled to the right of whose\nviolation he complains.\"\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/52\nParticulars of Misdirection\n(a) The alleged requirement has been criticized in\nAmerican Cyanamid v. Ethicon Ltd. (1975) AC. 396.\n(b) On the facts of his case, it was sufficient to show\nthat the plaintiff was a licencee of the Obeya\u00a0family;\n(c) In Agbor v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner\n(1969) 1 WLR 703 and Ojukwu v. Governor of\n14\nLagos State (1986) 3 NWLR 39 the plaintiff was a\nlicencee and the true owners of the premises (The\nBiafran Government and Ojukwu Transport Ltd.)\nwere not parties to the proceedings, at any rate at\nthe stage when interlocutory injunction was\ngranted;\n2. The Court below erred in law in failing to\nobserve that for the purpose of the interlocutory\napplication, the affidavit of John Ede (a director of\nthe plaintiff company) and of Obande Obeya (a\nmember of Obeya family) are sufficient to establish\nstatus of the plaintiff company as a licensee of the\nObeya family on the premises more so as those\naffidavits were not effectively contradicted by the\npurely hearsay affidavit evidence of the Chief Law\nofficer of Benue State.\n3. Irrespective of the outcome of the appeal before\nit, the\u00a0Court below erred in law and failed to\nexercise its discretion judicially in not directing that\nthe case be heard by another Judge of the High\u00a0Court.\nParticulars of Error\nThe\u00a0Court below found that the learned Chief Judge\nhas decided very vital issues of fact which can only\nproperly be decided at the trial of the substantive\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n14/52\nsuit. That being so, it ought to have directed that\nthe substantive trial be held before another Judge.\nAs the Chief Judge had transferred the\nsubstantive case from his\u00a0Court, the appellants'\ncounsel did not in oral argument press the issue of\ntransfer.\nThe questions posed by the grounds of appeal for\n15\ndetermination in this appeal and formulated in the\nbrief of arguments filed by the appellant are two\nfold. They are:\n\"(1) What are the quality and quantity of the\nevidence which the plaintiff require to establish in\nthe High Court to support its application for\ninterlocutory injunction?\n(2) Were the affidavit evidence of John Ede and\nObande Obeya of the quality and quantity\nrequired?\"\nChief F.R.A. Williams, SAN, submitted both in the\nappellant's brief and at the oral hearing of this\nappeal that in this application all that the\nplaintiff/appellant need show is that the action is\nnot frivolous or vexatious. He commended the\ncomment of Lord Diplock in American Cyanamid\nv. Ethicon Ltd. (1975) AC. 396 at 407G that the\nuse of such expressions as \"a probability\", \"'a prima\nfacie case\" or a strong prima facie case\" in the\ncontext of the exercise of a discretionary power to\ngrant an interlocutory injunction leads to confusion,\nas to the object to be achieved by this form of\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/52\ntemporary relief. He contended that it is wrong to\nrequire the appellant to produce evidence to\ndemonstrate that he is bound to succeed in the trial\nof the substantive case. He also relied on the\nobservation of Coker, J. in Kufeji v. Kogbe (1961) 1\nAll NLR. 113 at 114 that:\n\"in an application for interim relief by way of\ninjunction, it is not necessary that a plaintiff or\napplicant should make out a case as he would on\n16\nthe merits, it being sufficient that he should\nestablish that there is a substantial issue to be tried\nat the hearing.\"\nHe also cited the case of Egbe v. Onogun (1972) 1\nAll NLR (Part 1) 95 at 98 where the above passage\nwas cited with approval.\nLearned Counsel submitted that the affidavit\nevidence produced by the plaintiff/appellant clearly\nestablished the fact that there is a serious\nsubstantial question to be tried. He submitted that\nit was and is not necessary to adduce oral evidence\nto prove 'averments' (sic) in the affidavit and cited\nLadunni v. Kukoyi (1972) 1 All NLR 133 where this\nCourt held that it was not necessary for a person\napplying for interlocutory injunction to restrain\ntrespass pending trial to proceed further.\nThe contents of an affidavit or facts deposed to\nin an affidavit are deposed on oath. Those set out\nin the statement of claim are not. The affidavit\nevidence amount to proof whereas the averment in\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n16/52\nthe statement of claim is not. He then cited Egbe v.\nOnogun (supra). He contended that the plaintiff is\nonly the operator and manager of the hospital\nthrough staff, officers and agents employed by it.\nThese are the people prevented from carrying out\ntheir functions by the military and army personnel.\nLearned Counsel contends that the appellant\nbeing a body corporate can only be and is in\noccupation of the premises through these\nemployees. He submitted that appellant need not\nprove proprietary interest in the premises to\nsucceed and cited Agbor v. Metropolitan Police\n17\nCommissioner (supra) and Ojukwu v. Governor of\nLagos State (supra). It is enough if the appellant is\nlawfully in occupation with the authority of the\nowner. He then submitted that the affidavit\nevidence of John Ede and Obande Obeya were\nsufficient to support the application. He contended\nthat on the issue of occupation, the affidavit\nevidence of the Attorney-General of Benue State is\nall hearsay and failed to contradict the facts sworn\nto by the plaintiffs/appellants' witnesses.\nThe learned D.P.P. for Benue State, Mr. Aboyi J.\nIkongbeh contended that the appellant failed to\nprove occupation although he admitted that the\narmy and airforce personnel who seized the\nhospital did not find Obande Obeya in occupation\nwhen they entered the premises. He submitted that\nObande Obeya was a debtor to the government and\nin the belief that the hospital belonged to him, the\narmy and airforce personnel, on the request of the\nRecovery of Public Fund and Property Panel\nthrough the Military Governor siezed the property\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n17/52\nin satisfaction of any amount he is owing.\nThe learned D.P.P. submitted that the appellant\ndid not make out a prima facie case to entitle him\nto the interlocutory injunction and interlocutory\nmandatory injunction prayed. He contended that\nthe facts deposed in the supporting affidavit of John\nEde and Obande Obeya are not sufficient to show\nthat the case is not frivolous or vexatious. He\nfurther contended that Agbor's and Ojukwu's case\nare distinguishable on the facts, from the instant\nappeal.\n18\nJ.B. Ajala Esq., Director of Civil Litigation in the\nFederal Ministry of Justice appearing for the first\nrespondent, adopted the submissions of Mr.\nIkongbeh. He asked that the appeal be dismissed\nsince the appellants conceded that they have\nnothing to complain against the first respondent.\nHe submitted that an applicant must, to succeed in\nan application for interim injunction, establish a\nstrong prima facie case. He then cited Woluchem v.\nInko Taria Wokoma (1974) 3 SC. 153. He further\nsubmitted that where damages would compensate\nfor any injury done, the application should be\nrefused. He submitted that Benue State\nGovernment is in a position to pay whatever\ndamages that their action now being challenged\nmay entail. Chief Williams, SAN, in reply pointed\nout that the appellant joined the Attorney-General\nof the Federation because the army and the\nairforce personnel were involved. He commented\nthat even if Obande Obeya were the sole owner of\nObeya Memorial Hospital, it would not be right to\nseize it by force and referred to the provision of\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/52\nSection 40 of the Constitution of the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria, 1979. He concluded by\nsubmitting that the affidavit of Obande Obeya\nclearly proves that the plaintiff was in possession.\nIt is common ground that the Benue State\ngovernment took over Obeya Memorial Hospital\nwith the assistance of army and airforce personnel.\nIt is important to keep in clear view, the application\nbefore the Court. Briefly, it is an application for\ninterim injunction pending the determination of the\n19\nsubstantive suit. The interlocutory nature of the\napplication determines the nature of case to be\nmade out by the applicant to entitle it to the order.\nThe nature of the case determines the quantum of\nproof or evidence.\nWhat\u00a0are\u00a0the\u00a0principles\u00a0governing\u00a0the\u00a0grant\u00a0of\nan interlocutory injunction? The governing\nprinciples\u00a0are\u00a0fairly\u00a0well settled\u00a0although\u00a0the\nstatement\u00a0and\u00a0restatement\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0principles\u00a0has, in\nsome\u00a0cases,

Neither\nhas the counter-affidavit of Bernard Iyorbyam\nHom, the Attorney General of Benue State been\n22\ntested in oral cross-examination.\nThe purpose sought to be achieved by giving to\nthe\u00a0Court discretion to grant such injunctions would\nbe stultified if the discretion were clogged by a\ntechnical rule forbidding its exercise, if upon that\nincomplete untested evidence, the\u00a0Court evaluated\nthe chances of the plaintiff's ultimate success in the\naction at 50 per cent or less but permitting its\nexercise if the\u00a0Court evaluated his chances at more\nthan 50 per cent.\nThe confusion generated by the use of the term\nstrong prima facie case has been imported into\nsome of our judicial authorities which followed\nEnglish decisions.\nIn Abel O. Woluchem v. Dr. Charles Inko Tariah\nWokoma (1974) 3-5 SC. 153 at 156, Ibekwe, J.S.C.\ndelivering the judgment of the Supreme Court\nstated the rule thus:\n\"The rule is that a plaintiff seeking an interlocutory\ninjunction must establish a strong prima facie case\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/52\nfor the existence of his right and at least that he\nwas likely to succeed on that issue and also a prima\nfacie case of infringement of his right. In exercising\nits discretion to grant the relief, the\u00a0Court would\nhave regard to the balance of convenience.\"\nThen he went on to comment:\n\"We fail to see how a\u00a0Court of law could be able to\nsatisfy all or any of these principles before\npleadings were filed and without evaluating some\nsort of evidence (be it oral or affidavit evidence by\nboth parties).\"\nAnother case worthy of mention in this regard is\n23\nLadunni v. Kukoyi & Ors (1972) 1 ALL NLR (Part 1)\n133. Explaining the principle, Coker, J.S.C.\ndelivering the judgment of the Court, said at page\u00a0138:\n\"The principle seems to us to be clear and in\nshort, an interim injunction would be granted to a\nparty who shows that he has a prima facie case on\na claim of right or in other words that, prima facie,\nthe case he has made out is one which the\nopposing party would be called upon to answer and\nthat it is just and convenient to the\u00a0Court to\nintervene and that unless the\u00a0Court so intervenes\nat that stage, the other party's action or conduct\nwould irreparably alter the status quo or render\nineffective any subsequent decree of the\u00a0Court.\"\nThe Court\u00a0had\u00a0earlier\u00a0at\u00a0page\u00a0137\u00a0adopted\u00a0with\napproval\u00a0the\u00a0dictum\u00a0of\u00a0Ungoed-Thomas,\u00a0J.\u00a0in\nDonmar\u00a0Production\u00a0Ltd.\u00a0v.\u00a0Bart\u00a0and\u00a0Ors (1967)\u00a01\nWLR\u00a0740\u00a0at\u00a0742\u00a0with\u00a0respect\u00a0to\u00a0this\u00a0point\u00a0which\nreads:\n\"So\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0application\u00a0for\u00a0an\u00a0interlocutory\u00a0injunction,\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/52\nthe\u00a0applicant\u00a0must\u00a0establish\u00a0a\u00a0probability\u00a0or\u00a0a\nstrong\u00a0prima\u00a0facie\u00a0case\u00a0that\u00a0he\u00a0is\u00a0entitled\u00a0to\u00a0the\nright\u00a0of\u00a0whose\u00a0violation\u00a0he\u00a0complains\u00a0and,\u00a0subject\nto this being established, the governing\nconsideration\u00a0is\u00a0the\u00a0maintenance\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0status\u00a0quo\npending\u00a0the\u00a0trial.\nIt\u00a0is\u00a0well\u00a0established\u00a0that\u00a0in\u00a0deciding\u00a0whether\u00a0the\nmatter\u00a0shall\u00a0be\u00a0maintained\u00a0in\u00a0status\u00a0quo, regard\nmust\u00a0be\u00a0had\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0balance\u00a0of\u00a0convenience\u00a0and\u00a0to\nthe\u00a0extent\u00a0to\u00a0which\u00a0any\u00a0damage\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0plaintiffs\ncan\u00a0be\u00a0cured\u00a0by\u00a0payment\u00a0of\u00a0damages\u00a0rather\u00a0than\n24\nby\u00a0the\u00a0granting\u00a0of\u00a0injunction.\u00a0Of\u00a0course\u00a0the\u00a0burden\nof proof lies on the applicant throughout.\"\nOf this statement, Coker, JSC, said at p. 137:\n\"we think this is a correct proposition of the law\nand we propose to apply it to the case in hand.\"\n?\nBecause of the confusion caused in the minds of\nJudges by the use of the cliche \"prima facie case or\nprobability or strong prima facie case\", the law with\nrespect to interim injunction has been aptly\ndescribed by Coker, JSC. (see Ladunni v. Kukoyi &\nAnor (supra) at p.136) as constituting one of the\nmost difficult sections of our law. The difficulty\nexists not because the law is recondite but because\nthe ascertained principles must be subjected at all\ntimes to a rather amorphous combination of facts\nwhich are perpetually different in every case.\nThe learned trial Judge, whose decision came to\nthe Supreme Court on appeal and was affirmed,\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/52\nstating the principle which guided him, said\n\"....The principle on which the Court will act in\nan application for an order of interlocutory\ninjunction is well settled and it is that the Court\nshould be satisfied that there is a serious question\nto be tried at the hearing and that on the facts before\nit, there is a probability that the plaintiff is entitled to\nrelief.\"\nThis principle is almost a restatement of the dictum\nof Lord Diplock in American Cyanamid v. Ethicon\nLtd. (Supra). The point appears to have been more\ncorrectly stated by this Court in Egbe v. Onogun\n(1972) 1 All NLR, 95 at 98, when it said:\n\"In Kufeji v. Kogbe (1961) All NLR 113 which deals\nwith the practice and procedure governing applications\nfor interim injunctions, Coker J. (as he then was) stated\nat page 114\n'In an application for interim relief by way of injunction,\nit is not necessary that a plaintiff or applicant should\nmake out a case as he would do on the merits, it being\nsufficient that he should establish that there is a\nsubstantial issue to be tried at the hearing.'...\nIn a case of interim injunction, it is not necessary\nto determine the legal right to a claim since at that\nstage, as it is in this case, there can be no such\ndetermination; because pleadings have not been\nfiled, no issue joined, and no oral evidence\nadduced; therefore there cannot be any finding on\nthe merits.\"\nHaving examined the principles governing the\ngrant of interlocutory or interim injunction, it is\nnow necessary to examine the facts of this instant\nappeal. These are set out clearly in the short\naffidavit of John Ede containing 11 paragraphs,\n25\nparagraphs 1 to 10 which contain the material facts\nread:\n\"1. I am a director of the plaintiff company and by\nvirtue of this I am familiar with the facts to which I\ndepose;\n2. The Plaintiff has filed an action against the\nFederal Government and the Benue State\nGovernment claiming the following reliefs:\n(i) a declaration that the entry of the land and\nbuildings of the Obeya Memorial Specialist Hospital\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/52\nOturkpo Town in Oturkpo Local Government Area\nby Army and Airforce personnel as well as by\nofficers and servants of the Government of Benue\nState was unlawful and amounts to trespass;\n(ii) a declaration that the Government of Benue\nState has no right to take or retain possession of\nthe said land and buildings from the plaintiff save\nin accordance with due process of law;\n(iii) an order for inquiry into damages suffered by\nthe plaintiff as a result of the unlawful entry of the\nsaid land and buildings.(a) by Nigerian Army and\n(b) Nigerian Airforce personnel;\n(iv) an order for inquiry into damages suffered by\nthe plaintiff as a result of the trespass committed\nby the Benue State Government on the plaintiff's\ngoods as well as on the said land and buildings;\n(v) an order for payment of appropriate sums as\ncompensatory and/or exemplary damages to the\nplaintiff for the acts of trespass aforementioned;\nand\n(vi) an injunction restraining all officers of the\nNigerian Army and Airforce and all officers,\n26\nservants and agents of the Benue State\nGovernment from continuing the said acts of\ntrespass or committing further acts of trespass or\nfrom preventing the plaintiff, its officers, servants\nand licensees from obtaining access to the land and\nbuildings used for the purposes of the Obeya\nMemorial Specialist Hospital.\n3. At all times material to this action, the plaintiff\nwas in occupation of the land and buildings in\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/52\nOturkpo Local Government Area, Benue State\nwhich buildings are used for the purpose of a\nhospital known as Obeya Memorial Specialist\u00a0Hospital.\n4. The said Hospital was duly registered as a\nmedical institution pursuant to the provisions of\nthe Private Hospital Law 1963 Cap. 100 Revised\nLaws of Northern Nigeria. The plaintiff will rely on\nthe Certificate of Registration dated 17th\nDecember, 1982 issued by the Ministry of Health\nBenue State of Nigeria;\n5. On 24th January, 1986, some 30 Nigerian Army\npersonnel and about 10 Nigerian Airforce\npersonnel all armed, entered the land and buildings\nused for the purposes of the hospital, and\neffectively took possession of the same;\n6. On 25th of January, 1986, the Benue State\nCommissioner for Health, Benue State, Mrs. Lucy\nAluor after inspecting the whole hospital, carted\naway all the records of the hospital including all\npersonal files of all staff;\n7. On 6th February, 1986, the Military Governor of\nBenue State, Group Captain Jonah David Jang, in\n27\ncompany of the Commissioner for Health, Benue\nState, Mrs. Lucy Aluor, visited the hospital and\nordered that the security walls of the hospital be\nincreased in height by the Benue State Ministry of\nWorks and Housing;\n8. On 7th February, 1986, officials from the Benue\nState Ministry of Health arrived with about 10 extra\nsoldiers heavily armed and summoned all the staff\nand served most of the staff with termination\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/52\nletters with effect from 7th February, 1986. They\nthen ordered all patients on admission in the\nhospital out of the hospital;\n9. The hospital has now remained closed to both\nstaff and patients since then and it is heavily\nguarded by armed personnel;\n10. To the best of my knowledge, information and\nbelief, unless restrained by order of\u00a0Court, the\nofficers and men of the Army now occupying the\nsaid hospital and the Benue State Government\nintend to continue to keep the plaintiff and its\nagents, officers, servants and licensees out of\npossession of the premises permanently or for an\nindefinite period and also to keep them from\nentering the said premises.\nThe Attorney-General of Benue State, Mr. Bernard\nIyorlyam Hom deposed to a lengthy counter-\naffidavit with which he exhibited many documents\nconcerning Obeya Memorial Hospital. One of the\ndocuments shows that the plaintiff was\nincorporated on the 2nd day of September, 1985. It\nwas the certificate of incorporation of Obeya\nMemorial Specialist Hospital Ayi-Onyema Family\n28\nLimited.\nMr. Oche Uche a civil servant, also deposed to a\ncounter-affidavit paragraph 2 of which was to the\neffect that Obeya Obande on 26th June, 1985\nadmitted to the panel on Recovery of Public Fund\nand Property that the hospital was a joint project\nbetween him and his family. Obande Obeya also\nswore to an affidavit in reply to the counter-\naffidavit on 10th April, 1986.\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/52\nParagraphs 8 and 9 of the affidavit read:\n\"8. The buildings comprising the hospital were\nfinanced by the Obeya family and not me\npersonally;\n9. The plaintiff company was incorporated by the\nObeya family and other persons to manage and run\nthe hospital. It is incorrect to suppose that the\nplaintiff company is required to register for the\npurpose of operating or managing the business of\nthe hospital.\"\nHe also exhibited a copy of the certificate of\noccupancy issued to the Obeya Memorial Hospital to\nhold the land for a term of 30 years from 1st day of\nAugust, 1982.\nFrom the facts before the Court, it cannot be\ndenied that there is a serious question to be tried\nand that the burden of proof on the applicant at\nthis stage has been discharged. There is affidavit\nevidence that the appellant was in occupation of\nthe hospital building and operating the hospital\nservices. The action of the respondent has caused a\nserious disruption of the services. The seizure of\nthe hospital buildings by heavily armed Army and\n29\nAirforce personnel from unarmed law abiding\ncitizens should not be encouraged or applauded in a\ndemocratic society such as ours where the Rule of\nLaw reigns. It is more honourable to follow the due\nprocess of law. It is also more respectful and more\nrewarding to follow such a course.\nThe question may be asked \"what has the Benue\nState Government gained by the seizure so far?\nThe answer is \"nothing.\" It has not recovered the\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n29/52\ndebt owed to it by Obande Obeya. Instead it has\nfound itself saddled with costly litigation. It may be\ncontended that the Benue State Government\nfollowed the due process of law in that it was the\npowers vested in the Recovery Panel established by\nthe Recovery of Public Funds and Property (Special\nProvisions) Edict 1983 that was exercised, that led\nto the seizure of the Obeya Memorial Specialist\nHospital. The power vested in the panel was to be\nexercised against the property of any person\nindebted or liable to the government or agency of\nthe State. This is emphasized in the provision of\nSection 5(e) of the Edict which reads:\n\"For the effective carrying out of its function under\nthis Edict, the Recovery Panel shall have power -\n'to take possession of and sell at public auction, any\nmovable or immovable property of any person\nindebted or liable to the government or agency of\nthe State, or surcharged by the government, in\nsatisfaction of the debt or surcharge.\"\nThe counter affidavit of Patrick Oche Uche sworn\non 3rd of April, 1986 in paragraph 2 shows quite\nclearly that Obande Obeya had given the panel\n30\ninformation that the hospital was a joint project\nbetween him and his family. It reads:\n\"That when Obande Obeya appeared before us on\n26th June, 1985, and was questioned in relation to\nthe hospital he is said to own, he admitted that the\nhospital was a joint project between him and his\nfamily. That I hereby exhibited a certified true copy\nof the relevant pages of the transcript of our\nverbatim reporters minutes of our proceedings of\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n30/52\nthe day and mark it as Exhibit POV1\"\nThere is affidavit evidence from Obande Obeya on\nthis issue. In the light of the affidavit evidence, the\nCourt of Appeal and the High Court erred in holding\nthat the appellant failed to prove that it was in\noccupation for the purpose of the application for\ninterim injunction and mandatory injunction.\nA force of 30 army and10airforce personnel\nheavily armed is surely not needed by the panel to\ntake possession of the hospital from Obande Obeya\nif Obande Obeya alone were running the hospital\nand in occupation himself. The deployment of such\na force is like using a sledge hammer to kill a fly.\nHowever, this is not the stage at which the\nquestion of the ownership of the land and buildings\nof the hospital is to be determined. It is one of the\nserious questions raised by the 2nd respondent to\nbe decided at the hearing of the substantive case.\nThe only question for consideration by the Court in\nthe instant appeal in the light of all the facts placed\nbefore the Court in the affidavits and counter\naffidavits is the question of balance of convenience.\nWho will stand to lose more if the status quo ante\n31\nis restored and maintained till the final\ndetermination of the suit? Will the Benue State\nGovernment stand to lose more if it is returned to\nits former position, than the appellant if the\nappellant is not returned to its former position? It is\nobvious that the appellant will lose more. The\nBenue State Government will lose nothing if it\nwithdraws from the hospital premises till the final\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/52\ndetermination of the action. The appellant, if not\nrestored to occupation now would have lost\ntremendously in goodwill, patients, finance and\nmanagement skill if it ultimately succeeds in the\nsubstantive action.\nThe balance of convenience is therefore in\nfavour of granting the application. I must stress\nthat the government is entitled to pursue its\ndebtors and recover from them all amounts\nlegitimately due to it. The\u00a0Courts of law are\nestablished both for the people and the government\nor authority. The government should not shy away\nfrom making use and taking advantage of the\nprocesses of the\u00a0Courts of law. It is a misconception\nto think that the measured speed with which the\nprocesses of\u00a0Court travel is too slow for the military\ngovernment. Since the government has taken the\ncivilised stand of observing the Human Rights\nprovision of the 1979 Constitution and the Rule of\nLaw, it cannot allow its image to be tarnished,\nstained and mutilated by\u00a0Rule of Force which, in the\npeculiar circumstances, is very barren. The rule of\nforce wearing the kid glove of an Edict can never\n32\nusher in social justice. It only wears the condemned\nface of the law. Let the Benue State Government\nreturn to the Rule of Law.\nThe appeal succeeds and is hereby allowed. The\ndecisions of the Court of Appeal and the High Court\nare hereby set aside and in their stead, I make the\nfollowing orders:\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/52\n(1) The 1st and 2nd respondents by themselves,\ntheir servants including the 30 officers and men of\nthe Nigerian Army and the 10 officers and men of\nthe Nigerian Airforce or their agents are hereby\nrestrained from preventing the plaintiff and its\nservants or agents from obtaining access to and\noccupying the premises known as Obeya Memorial\nSpecialist Hospital, pending the determination of the\nsubstantive action;\n(2) The Benue State Government, the 2nd\nrespondent, is hereby ordered to restore possession\nof the said premises to the plaintiff pending the\ndetermination of the substantive action; and\n(3) The Benue State Government, the 2nd\nrespondent, by itself, its servants or agents or\notherwise, is hereby restrained from delivering\npossession of the said premises to any person other\nthan the plaintiff or its duly authorized agent\npending the determination of the substantive\naction.\nThe appellant is entitled to costs in this appeal\nassessed at N300.00 in this Court; N150.00 in the\nCourt of Appeal and N50.00 in the High Court.\nAUGUSTINE NNAMANI, J.S.C.:\nI had a preview of the judgment\n33\njust delivered by my learned brother, Obaseki,\nJ.S.C., and I entirely agree with his reasoning and\nconclusions in this matter.\nWhat was involved in this appeal was an\napplication for interim injunction pending the\ndetermination of the substantive suit between the\nparties. Based on the affidavit evidence before it,\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n33/52\nboth the High Court of Benue State and the Court\nof Appeal Jos Judicial Division, refused to grant the\nrelief holding that the appellant herein had not\nmade out a strong prima facie case. In its appeal to\nthis Court, the appellant in ground 2 of its grounds\nof appeal complained that. -\n\"(ii) The\u00a0Court below erred in law in failing to\nobserve that for the purpose of the interlocutory\napplication, the affidavit of John Ede (a director of\nthe plaintiff Company) and of Obande Obeya (a\nmember of the Obeya family) are sufficient to\nestablish the status of the plaintiff company as a\nlicensee of the Obeya family on the premises, the\nmore so as those affidavits were not effectively\nchallenged or contradicted by the purely hearsay\naffidavit evidence of the Chief Law Officer of Benue\nState\"\nAlso in its brief of argument, the appellant\nidentified the questions for determination as, -\n\"(i) What are the quality and quantity of the\nevidence which the plaintiff was required to\nestablish in the High Court to support its\napplication for interlocutory injunction?\n(ii) Were the affidavit evidence of John Ede and\nObeya of the quality and quantity so required?\"\n34\nThe 2nd Respondent thought that the question\nwas,-\n\"whether or not on the affidavit evidence before\nthe Court, the trialCourt and the Court of Appeal\nwere justified in holding that the appellant had not\nestablished a strong prima facie case to entitle it to\ninjunction.\"\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n34/52\nI think it is pertinent to mention that the appellant\nis an incorporated entity and was so incorporated\non 2nd September, 1985, long before the entry\ninto the hospital on 24th January, 1986 by the\ncombined team of Army and Airforce Personnel. It\nis also pertinent to mention that both John Ede and\nObande Obeya are among the shareholders who\nsubscribed to the Memorandum of Association of\nthe appellant company. From the claims of the\nappellant in the substantive Suit, one of which is -\n\"a declaration that the Government of Benue State\nhas no right to take or retain possession of the land\nand building comprising the said hospital save in\naccordance with due process of law\", the affidavits\nfiled by the parties, and the arguments by counsel\non both sides before this Court; it seems to me that\nthere is undoubtedly a serious question to be\ndecided between the parties. From the affidavit and\npapers filed by the 2nd Respondents, it would\nappear that Obande Obeya had applied and\nobtained a grant of certificate of occupancy in\nrespect of land on which a Hospital known as Obeya\nMemorial Hospital stands; that the said hospital is\nregistered under the laws of Benue State; that\nObande Obeya appeared before a Panel on\n35\nRecovery of Public Funds and Property set up by\nthe Benue State Government, and that he was\nadjudged to owe that Government some funds\nfollowing a contract which he did not execute. Then\nthere is the Recovery of Public Funds and Property\n(Special Provisions) Edict 1985 under which the\n2nd Respondent purports to have acted. Section\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n35/52\n5(e) of that Edict permits the Recovery Panel to-\n\"take possession of and sell by public auction, any\nmovable or immovable property of any person\nindebted or liable to the Government or agency of\nthe State, or surcharged by the Government, in\nsatisfaction of the debt or surcharge.\"\nThe contention of the 2nd Respondent is that the\nappellant is known to them, and that in effect, the\nhospital is the property of Obande Obeya which can\nbe seized and dealt with as per the Edict referred to\nabove.\nSurely the question of who the owners of the\nappellant are can only be determined in the course\nof the substantive Suit. It is only then that it would\nbecome clear whether it belongs to Obande Obeya,\nand whether there was an attempt to use the\nappellant to wriggle out of the alleged indebtedness\nto the Government. Other issues that would be\ndetermined during such hearing include the\nquestion whether appellant was registered in\naccordance with the Hospital Law of Benue State\nand the question whether Obande Obeya is the\nholder of the land - either by statutory or\ncustomary grant of certificate of occupancy - on\nwhich the hospital stands. Can it therefore be\n36\nargued that these issues can be determined at the\npoint when a\u00a0Court is considering a prayer for\ninterim injunction? Or put another way, can it be\nsaid that these issues do not raise serious questions\nto be tried justifying a grant of injunction to\nmaintain the status quo until such trial? I think not.\nThe\u00a0principles\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0grant\u00a0of\u00a0interim\u00a0injunction\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n36/52\nhave\u00a0been\u00a0settled\u00a0in\u00a0decisions\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Courts\u00a0in\u00a0this\ncountry\u00a0and\u00a0in\u00a0England.\u00a0See- American\u00a0Cyanamid\nvs.\u00a0Ethicon Ltd.\u00a0(1975)\u00a0A.C.\u00a0396;\u00a0Egbe\u00a0vs\u00a0Onogun\n(1972)\u00a01\u00a0All\u00a0N.L.R.\u00a0Pt.\u00a0195,98.\u00a0In\u00a0Kufeji\u00a0v.\u00a0Kogbe\n1961\u00a01\u00a0All\u00a0N.L.R.113,\u00a0114 Coker,\u00a0J.(as\u00a0he\u00a0then\nwas)\u00a0set\u00a0the\u00a0test\u00a0which\u00a0has\u00a0been\u00a0accepted\u00a0these\nyears.\u00a0He\u00a0said-\n\"In\u00a0an\u00a0application\u00a0for\u00a0interim\u00a0relief\u00a0by\u00a0way\u00a0of\ninjunction,\u00a0it\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0necessary\u00a0that\u00a0a\u00a0plaintiff\u00a0or\napplicant\u00a0should\u00a0make\u00a0out\u00a0a\u00a0case\u00a0as\u00a0he\u00a0would\u00a0on\nthe\u00a0merits,\u00a0it\u00a0being\u00a0sufficient\u00a0that\u00a0he\u00a0should\nestablish\u00a0that\u00a0there\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0substantial\u00a0issue\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0tried\nat the hearing\"\nI think I have said enough to indicate that I think\nsuch has been established on the papers and\naffidavits of the appellant.\nThen the question was raised that the appellant\nwas not known to the 2nd Respondent and had not\nshown that it was in possession or had interest in\nthe hospital.

All they say is that they don't know\nappellant.\nIt would seem to me that in all the\ncircumstances of this case, the balance of\nconvenience lies in favour of the appellant. As\nregards the use of force to take possession of the\npremises, I cannot improve on what has been said\nby my learned brother Obaseki, J.S.C. on the issue.\nI, too, would hope that the Benue State Government\nwould return to the path of due process. If indeed\nthe panel was convinced that the premises\nbelonged to Obande Obeya, did they need to take it\n38\nin the manner they did? From the papers, there is\nnothing to show that there was a counter claim\nagainst the appellant, nor was there a substantive\nclaim against Obande Obeya.\nFor these reasons, and the more detailed\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n38/52\nreasons in the lead judgment, I too would allow this\nappeal. I hereby endorse all the orders made by\nObaseki, J.S.C. including the order as to costs.\nMUHAMMADU LAWAL UWAIS, J.S.C.:\nThis appeal is essentially\ninterlocutory. It concerns the appellant's application\nmade in the High Court for an interim injunction to\nissue against the officers and men of the Nigerian\nArmy and the Nigerian Air Force who, allegedly had\ntaken possession, by force, of Obeya Memorial\nSpecialist Hospital in Oturkpo Local Government\nArea of Benue State. The application also sought\nfor an order compelling the 1st and 2nd\nrespondents herein to restore possession of the\nhospital to the appellant; and restraining the 1st\nand 2nd respondents, as well as their agents or\nservants from passing the possession of the\nhospital to any person other than the appellant.\nThe interlocutory application was refused by the\nHigh Court. There was an appeal against the\nrefusal, to the Court of Appeal. That appeal was\ndismissed and hence the appeal\u00a0is\u00a0now before this\nCourt. The facts of the case have been admirably\nset out in the judgment of my learned brother\nObaseki, J.S.C., the draft of which I had the\nprivilege of reading in advance. I entirely agree\nwith the judgment.\n39\nIn dealing with this appeal, it is necessary that care\nis taken not to decide any aspect of the substantive\ncontroversy between the parties, which is still\npending before the High Court, so as not to\nprejudice the case of any of the parties. It is in this\nregard that I feel obliged not to add anything more\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n39/52\nto the judgment of my learned brother Obaseki,\nJ.S.C. since it fully represents my opinion on the\nappeal.\nAccordingly, the appeal is hereby allowed and the\ndecisions of the lower\u00a0Courts are set-aside. I\nendorse the orders contained in the lead judgment.\nBOONYAMIN OLADIRAN KAZEEM, J.S.C.:\nI have had the opportunity of\nreading in draft, the judgment just delivered by my\nlearned brother Obaseki J.S.C. and I agree entirely\nwith the reasons and conclusions arrived at therein.\nHowever, I wish to add these few points by way of\nemphasis only.\nThe facts in this case which have been fully set\nout in the lead judgment were briefly that the\nAppellant was operating an hospital at Oturkpo in\nBenue State of Nigeria, but on 24th January, 1986,\nthe Recovery of Public Funds and Property Panel\n(hereinafter referred to as \"the Recovery Panel\")\nset up by the Government of Benue State of\nNigeria, with the aid of some personnel of the\nNigerian Airforce and the Army, forcibly ejected the\nAppellant's staff from the hospital and took over\npossession of the said premises. The Government\nof Benue State had since been operating the said\nhospital.\n40\nThe alleged reason given for taking such an\naction was that one Chief Obande Obeya had been\nfound by a Commission of Inquiry set up by the\nsame Government of Benue State, to be indebted\nto that government in some huge sum of money\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n40/52\ndue on a contract which was unpaid, and that the\nAppellant Company (which was regarded as Chief\nObande Obeya's property) was taken over by virtue\nof the powers vested upon the said Recovery Panel\nunder the Recovery of Public Funds and Property\n(Special Provision) Edict 1985: Edict No. 1B of\n1985 in partial settlement of the said indebtedness.\nConsequently, the Appellant as plaintiff instituted\nlegal proceedings against the respondents as\ndefendants for declarations that the action was\nunlawful and amounted to trespass. The Appellant\nalso sued for damages for trespass and an\ninjunction to restrain the respondents from\ncontinuing the said trespass. However, pending the\ndetermination of the said action, the Appellant\napplied for the following orders:\n\"(1) An order restraining all the officers and men of the\nNigerian Army and the Nigerian Airforce by\nthemselves, their servants or agents or otherwise\nfrom preventing the plaintiff from obtaining access\nto and occupying the premises known as OBEYA\nMEMORIAL SPECIALIST HOSPITAL, AYI-ONYEMA\nFAMILY LIMITED.\n(2) An order requiring the Federal Government\nand/or the Benue State Government to restore\npossession of the said premises to the Plaintiff.\n(3) An order restraining the Federal Government\n41\nand/or Benue State Government by themselves,\ntheir servants or agents or otherwise from\ndelivering possession of the said premises to any\nperson other than the Plaintiff or it's duly\nauthorized agents.\"\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n41/52\nThe application was heard by the Chief Judge of\nthe High Court of Justice of the Benue State of\nNigeria holden at Makurdi and it was decided\nagainst the Appellant on the 7th of May, 1986.\nInter alia, the learned Chief Judge found that the\nAppellant had not shown by affidavit evidence that\nit was really in occupation or possession of the\npremises forcibly entered into at the time of\nGovernment operation. The application was\ntherefore refused. On an appeal against that\ndecision, the Court of Appeal in Jos similarly found\nthat the Appellant had not made out a strong prima\nfacie case that it was in possession of the premises\nfrom which it was forcibly ejected by the\ngovernment. The appeal was therefore dismissed.\nIn the appeal before us against that decision, the\nmain issue for consideration was whether the\nRespondents had any justifiable right in forcibly\ndepriving the Appellant of possession of the said\npremises with the aid of military personnel before\nthe determination of the pending action. It was\ncontended by the Appellant that it was at the\nmaterial time managing the hospital; and that\nbeing so, it was entitled to continue to do its job;\nand could not be evicted save by an order ofCourt.\nIt was also pointed out that the Appellant was an\nincorporate body which had been in existence since\n42\nthe 2nd of September, 1985; and it did not have to\nestablish any proprietary interest in the property\nonce it was still in possession. It was therefore\nmaintained that the action taken by the\nRespondents was not only high-handed, but that it\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n42/52\nwas equally unlawful as being against the Rule of\nLaw. The case of Military Governor of Lagos State &\nOrs v. Ojukwu & Anor (1986) 1 NWLR 621 at\npages 636 - 638 was cited in support.\nIn defence of their action, the Respondents\nrelied on the powers vested upon the Recovery\nPanel set up by the Government of Benue State,\nunder Section 5(e) of Edict No. 1B of 1985; and it\nwas submitted that in so far as Chief Obande Obeya\nwho owned the property (claimed by the Appellant)\nhad been adjudged by a Commission of Inquiry to\nbe indebted to the Government of Benue State, and\nthat indebtedness had not been discharged, their\naction was lawful.\nSection 5(e) of Edict No. 1B of 1985 on which\nthe Respondents relied provides as follows:-\n\"5. For the effective carrying out of its functions\nunder this Edict, the Recovery Panel shall have\npower:-\n(a) ...........................................\n(b) ...........................................\n(c) ............................................\n(d) ...........................................\n(e) to take possession of and sell by public auction,\nany movable or immovable property of any person\nindebted or liable to the Government or agency of\nthe State or surcharged by the Government, in\n43\nsatisfaction of the debt or surcharge.\"\nThere is no doubt that the provisions of Section\n5(e) of the Edict relied upon by the Respondents\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n43/52\nempowered the Recovery Panel \"to take possession\nof and sell by public auction, any movable or\nimmovable property of any person indebted or\nliable to the Government or agency of the State ....\nin satisfaction of the debt....\". But the question\nremains whether the Appellant as a Corporate body\nhas been so found to be indebted to the\nGovernment. Even in the case of Chief Obande\nObeya, it had not been established at the trial of\nthe substantive action that he was so indebted. The\naction taken by the Respondents seem to me rather\npremature. They should have waited until the\nsubstantive action had been tried and it has been\nfound that either the Appellant as a corporate body\nhad been indebted to the Government of Benue\nState; or that even Chief Obande Obeya was so\nindebted and owned the Appellant company; or that\nhe incorporated the Appellant company to frustrate\nthe effort of the Government in recovering the debt\nhe owed them.\nA Nigerian citizen and indeed any Nigerian\nCompany as a Corporate body in lawful possession\nof their properties are entitled to protection of\nthose properties under our Constitution; and until\nthey are proved not to be entitled, the Courts as\nguardians of the Rule of Law will frown at any\nunlawful invasion of such properties by anyone no\nmatter how highly placed. That point was made\nclear in the case of the Military Governor of Lagos\n44\nState & Ors v. Chief Emeka O. Ojukwu & Anor\n(supra). In that case, the property situate at 29\nQueens Drive belonged to the Ojukwu Transport\nLtd., before the civil war of 1967 - 1970. But during\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n44/52\nthe period of the Civil War, it was administered by\nthe Government of Lagos State as an abandoned\nproperty and let to G. Cappa Ltd. When G. Cappa\nLtd. vacated the premises after the civil war, Chief\nEmeka Ojukwu who claimed to have an interest in\nthe property took possession of it without the\nconsent of the Military Governor of Lagos State.\nWhen he was threatened with an eviction\ntherefrom by that Government, he instituted legal\nproceedings at the High Court of Lagos to challenge\nthe constitutionality of the decision to do so. While\nthe action was pending, Chief Ojukwu being\napprehensive that the Military Governor would use\nforce to eject him without resort to Court process,\nmade an interlocutory application for an interim\ninjunction to restrain the Governor from ejecting\nhim pending the determination of the action. An\nex-parte interim order was first made by the trial\nJudge pending the service of notice and hearing of\nthe application. The order was later discharged\nafter the application was heard and refused.\nThereafter, the Military Governor with over 150\narmed policemen, and without an order of\u00a0Court\nauthorizing him to do so, moved into the premises\nand threw Chief Ojukwu into the street. Chief\nOjukwu and Ojukwu Transport Ltd. subsequently\nappealed to the Court of Appeal in Lagos against\nthe refusal of the order of interim injunction; and\n45\nChief Ojukwu applied for an order to be re-instated\ninto possession. The Court of Appeal granted the\norder; and the Governor of Lagos State appealed\nagainst that order. The Governor of Lagos State\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n45/52\nalso asked for a Stay of Execution of the order of\nthe Court of Appeal pending the determination of\nthe appeal.\nThe Principal question for consideration in that\ncase was whether there was legal and\nconstitutional basis or authority for the action\ntaken by the Governor of Lagos State to eject Chief\nOjukwu from the premises, the subject-matter of a\npending matter between the parties before the High\nCourt.\nIn his own judgment, Obaseki J.S.C.\nobserved thus:-\n\"I can find no constitutional or legal authority to\nsupport the action of the appellants (i.e. the\nMilitary Government). Indeed all the authorities\nare the other way.\nIn the area where rule of law operates, the rule\nof self help by force is abandoned. Nigeria being\none of the countries in the world even in the third\nworld which proclaim loudly to follow the rule of\nlaw, there is no room for the rule of self help by\nforce to operate. Once a dispute has arisen\nbetween a person and the government or authority\nand the dispute has been brought before the\u00a0Court,\nthereby invoking the judicial powers of the state.\u00a0It\nis the duty of the government to allow the law to\ntake its course or allow the legal and judicial\nprocess to run its full course. The action the Lagos\nState Government took can have no other\n46\ninterpretation than the show of the intention to\npre-empt the decision of the\u00a0Court. The\u00a0Courts\nexpect the utmost respect of the law from the\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n46/52\ngovernment itself which rules by the law ...... If the\nGovernment of Lagos State wants possession from\nChief Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, it should apply\nfor an order of possession from the competent\nCourt of Law.\"\nIn refusing the application for a stay, my learned\nbrother observed:-\n\"I will be doing injustice to the cause of the rule of\nlaw if I grant this application and allow the eviction\nof the respondent to stand. The Nigerian\nConstitution is founded on the rule of law, the\nprimary meaning of which is that every thing must\nbe done according to law. It means also that\ngovernment should be conducted within the\nframe-work of recognised rules and principles which\nrestrict discretionary power, which Coke colourfully\nspoke of as 'golden and straight network of law as\nopposed to the uncertain and crooked cord of\ndiscretion' (see 4 Inst. 41). More relevant to the\ncase in hand, the rule of law means that disputes\nas to the legality of acts of government are to be\ndecided by Judges who are wholly independent of\nthe executive. See Wade on Administrative Law 5th\nEdition p.22-27. That is the position in this country\nwhere the judiciary has been made independent of\nthe executive by the Constitution of the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria,\u00a01979 as amended by Decree\nNo.1 of 1984 and No. 17 of 1985. The judiciary\ncannot shirk its sacred responsibility to the nation\n47\nto maintain the rule of law. It is both in the interest\nof the government and all persons in Nigeria. The\nlaw should be even-handed between the\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n47/52\ngovernment and citizens.\"\nThe above decision is very much applicable to\nthis case; and I am of the view that it will be sheer\ninjustice and against the rule of law which all\nJustices have sworn to maintain between two\nlitigating parties without fear or favour, affection or\nill-will.\nIn the circumstances, I will also allow the\nappeal; and make the same orders contained in the\nlead judgment of my learned brother Obaseki J.S.C.\nSAIDU KAWU, J.S.C.: I have had the advantage of reading\nin draft the lead judgment of my learned brother,\nObaseki, J.S.C. which has just been delivered and I\ncompletely agree with his reasoning and\nconclusions. I am also of the view that this appeal\nought to be allowed.\nThe appellant instituted an action in the High\nCourt of Benue State, Makurdi, against the\nrespondents claiming certain reliefs, and after the\nfiling of the action, applied to the\u00a0Court for:\n\"(1) An order restraining all the officers and men of\nthe Nigerian Army and the Nigerian Airforce by\nthemselves, their servants or agents or otherwise\nfrom preventing the plaintiff from obtaining access\nto and occupying the premises known as OBEYA\nMEMORIAL HOSPITAL, AYI-ONYEMA FAMILY\nLIMITED.\n(2) An order requiring the Federal Government\n48\nand/or the Benue State Government to restore\npossession of the said premises to the Plaintiff.\n(3) An order restraining the Federal Government\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n48/52\nand/or Benue State Government by themselves,\ntheir servants or agents or otherwise from\ndelivering possession of the said premises to any\nperson other than the Plaintiff or it's duly\nauthorised agents pending the determination of the\nabove action and for such further and/or other\norders as this Honourable Court may deem fit to\nmake in the circumstances.\"\nAt the conclusion of all the submissions made by\nlearned counsel on behalf of the parties, the\napplication was, on the 7th day of May, 1986\ndismissed by the learned Chief Judge of Benue\nState. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was\nunsuccessful as thatCourt upheld the decision of\nthe trialCourt. This is a further appeal to this Court.\nThere is no doubt that, as alleged by the\nappellant, some Army and Airforce personnel, at\nthe instance of the Government of Benue State,\ninvaded the hospital on the 24th January, 1986\nand forcibly took over possession of the premises.\nThis fact was not disputed by the respondents. The\ndispute was as to who was in occupation of the\nhospital on that date. It was the contention of the\nrespondents that Obande Obeya was the person in\noccupation and not the appellant. But on this issue,\nthere was before theCourt the affidavit evidence of\none John Ede, a director of the appellant company\nwho swore as follows:-\n49\n\"(1) I am a director of the plaintiff company and by\nvirtue of this I am familiar with the facts to which I\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n49/52\ndepose.\n(3) At all times material to this action, the plaintiff\nwas in occupation of the land and buildings in\nOturkpo Local Government Area, Benue State\nwhich buildings are used for the purposes of a\nHospital known as Obeya Memorial Specialist\nHospital.\n(5) On 24th January, 1986 some 30 Nigerian Army\npersonnel and about 10 Nigerian Airforce\npersonnel, all armed, entered the land and\nbuildings used for the purposes of the hospital, and\neffectively took possession of the same.\" In addition\nto this, there was the affidavit evidence of Obande\nObeya to the effect that the appellant was in\noccupation of the premises as a licensee of Obeya\nMemorial Hospital.\nIn my view, the affidavit evidence adduced by the\nappellant at that stage of the litigation, was\nenough to satisfy theCourt that the appellant was\nin occupation at the time of the trespass.\nNow, on the material placed before theCourts,\nwas the appellant not entitled to the grant of an\ninterlocutory order? I think it was. Applying the\nprinciples governing the grant of interlocutory\ninjunctions enunciated in American Cyanamid vs.\nEthicon Ltd. (1975) A.C. 396 at 407; Egbe vs.\nOnogun (1972) 1 All N.L. R. 95 at p.97 and Kufeji\nvs. Kogbe (1961) 1 All N.L.R 113 at 114 to the facts\nof this case, as set out in the affidavit of John Ede,\nI am in no doubt whatsoever that both the Court of\n50\nAppeal and the trial\u00a0Court were in error to have\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n50/52\nrefused the appellant's prayers.\nIn the circumstances, I too would allow the\nappeal. I abide by all the orders made in the lead\njudgment of my learned brother, Obaseki, J.S.C.\nincluding the order as to costs.\nAppeal allowed.\n51\nAppearances:\n5/8/25, 11:15 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n51/52\nChief F.R.A.

The defendant did not\nadmit the claim. The plaintiff gave evidence that his family granted the defendant a piece of land to\nbuild on; that he brought them palm wine, and that they agreed on the rent, which he stopped paying\nafter the ensuing year. The very first question put by the defendant was\n\u00a0\n\"In whose lifetime did I come to you with palm wine?\"\n\u00a0\nThus the plaintiff was alleging a grant of land, which the defendant was denying. At the outset of his\nevidence the defendant said\n\u00a0\n\"The land on which I live is ours.\"\n\u00a0\nThe plaintiff asked him\n\u00a0\n\"Can you swear with your brothers that his land in question belongs to you?\"\n\u00a0\nThe defendant answered\n\u00a0\n\"yes\".\n\u00a0\nAfter the defendant's case was concluded, the court re-opened the hearing, and received from the\nplaintiff a copy of the proceedings in case No. 24/1937 as showing that his family had obtained title\nagainst the defendant's late father. The court eventually gave judgment for the plaintiff relying on that\ncase as proving that \"where the defendant put up his building belongs to the plaintiff'; and the court\ngave judgment for payment of rent.\n\u00a0\n5/7/25, 1:09 PM\nGabriel Madukolu &Others v Johnson Nkemdilim (F.S.C. 344/1960 ) [1962] NGSC 4 (11 November 1962) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/1962/4/eng@1962-11-11\n3/16\nPlainly enough the dispute was on whether the plaintiff's family were the owners of the land on which\nthe defendant had his house; the title was actually decided by the court; and that appeared from the\njudgment itself to be the ground on which the judgment for payment of rent was based.\n\u00a0\nThere were proceedings on appeal which ended in a finding by the Senior Administrative officer, that\nthe plaintiff had failed to prove title to the land on which the defendant had his house and that there\nwas inadequate evidence to support his claim that the defendant had leased the land in dispute from\nhim; the judgment of the Native Court was set aside and the claim dismissed; and that decision was\nconfirmed by the Deputy Governor on 23rd January, 1957.\n\u00a0\nA year or so later, Gabriel\u00a0Madukolu, who had brought the 1956 suit on his family's behalf, together\nwith others sued the defendant anew in the Native Court claiming\n\u00a0\ndeclaration\u00a0of title to a parcel of land known and called \"Aniuno-Isigwu\" where the defendant put up\nhis compound.\n\u00a0\nThe defendant denied the claim. In questioning\u00a0Madukolu\u00a0the defendant reminded him of the former\ncase. When the defendant gave evidence, he began by saying that the case was\u00a0res\u00a0judicata\u00a0in the\nformer case No. 33/56, which he had won. The plaintiff asked him\n\u00a0\n\"Do you know whether it was title to land or rent was claimed in civil suit No. 33/56 which you said\nyou won?\"\n\u00a0\nAnd the defendant answered\n\u00a0\n\"It was case for rent\".\n\u00a0\nThe judgment of the Native Court was for the plaintiffs; it did not deal with the plea of\u00a0res\u00a0judicata.\n\u00a0\nRes\u00a0judicata\u00a0was included as a ground of complaint in the appeal to the County Court. The County\nCourt observed that the former case was for payment of rent and not for declaration of title; that the\nappellate judgment in that case was good so far as rent was concerned, but\u00a0ultra\u00a0vires\u00a0in regard to\ntitle. The County Court awarded the plaintiffs a reversionary title, which was upheld by the Magistrate,\nbut reversed by the High Court; hence this appeal by the plaintiffs.\n\u00a0\nThe ground of appeal argued is that\n5/7/25, 1:09 PM\nGabriel Madukolu &Others v Johnson Nkemdilim (F.S.C. 344/1960 ) [1962] NGSC 4 (11 November 1962) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/1962/4/eng@1962-11-11\n4/16\n\u00a0\nThe learned Judge in the Court below is wrong in law when he held that the issue of tenancy\nin\u00a0Mbatechete\u00a0Native Court suit 33/1956 was\u00a0res\u00a0judicata.\n\u00a0\nIt must be admitted that the judgment is not consistent. At one point it states that\n\u00a0\nThe County Court did consider it\u00a0(viz.\u00a0the judgment of the Senior Administrative Officer in the former\nsuit) and rightly disregarded the remark that the respondents had failed to prove title, which was not\ndirectly in issue, but the second arm, that no tenancy was proved and the dismissal of the claim for\nrent was not given its due weight.\n\u00a0\nIf title was not directly in issue, then one of the elements of\u00a0res\u00a0judicata\u00a0was absent. The learned Judge\ngives it as his view that\n\u00a0\nThe judgment is not only conclusive with reference to the actual matter decided but to the grounds\nfor the decision.\n\u00a0\nThat is true provided that the ground for the decision relates to a fact directly in issue. Ultimately the\njudgment states that\n\u00a0\nIn the circumstances of this case, if the issue of tenancy is\u00a0res\u00a0judicata,\u00a0so is the issue of title since one\nis based upon the other.\n\u00a0\nThat seems to say this: the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant was their tenant as a person to whom\nthey had granted land of their own to build on and pay rent for; so the claim of tenancy was based on\na claim of ownership; so the former judgment was conclusive on title as well as on tenancy by lease. In\neffect the learned Judge regarded title as being a fact directly in issue in the former case by necessary\nimplication.\n\u00a0\nThe argument for the plaintiffs in their appeal before us was that the claim in the former suit was for\nrent; that the issue there was whether the defendant owed rent; and that was what the Native Court\nadjudicated upon: there was no issue on title, according to the argument, and the case was not fought\non that issue; the dismissal of the suit by the Senior Administrative officer decided nothing, as the suit\nwas not for a declaration of title: further, according to the argument, if the defendant tried to raise the\nissue of title, he did so too late.\n\u00a0\nThe rule of\u00a0res\u00a0judicata\u00a0is derived from the maxim of\u00a0nemo\u00a0debet\u00a0bis\u00a0vexaripro\u00a0eadem\u00a0causa.\u00a0It is\nthe\u00a0causa\u00a0that matters; and a plaintiff cannot, by formulating a fresh claim, re-litigate the\n5/7/25, 1:09 PM\nGabriel Madukolu &Others v Johnson Nkemdilim (F.S.C. 344/1960 ) [1962] NGSC 4 (11 November 1962) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/1962/4/eng@1962-11-11\n5/16\nsame\u00a0causa.\u00a0That is why section 53 of the Evidence Act does not speak of the claim, but of the facts\ndirectly in issue in the previous case. The previous case was in the Native Court, and as there are no\npleadings, one must go by the substance as disclosed in the proceedings.\u00a0The dispute was on title,\nand the ultimate decision was against the plaintiffs on their basic cause of action, that they were the\nowners and grantors of the land occupied by the defendant; nor is it true that he raised the issue of\ntitle too late.\u00a0The plaintiffs were debarred by that decision from claiming a declaration of title in a\nfresh case based on the same cause of action.\n\u00a0\nThe following authorities were cited in the course of the hearing of the appeal: on the plaintiffs' behalf\n\u00a0\n(1)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spencer Bower\u00a0on\u00a0Res\u00a0Judicata,\u00a0which is not available in our library;\n\u00a0\n(2)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Halsbury's\u00a0Laws of England\u00a0(2nd Ed,) vol. 13, paragraphs 466 and 488, which is discussed and\napplied in\n\u00a0\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Commissioner of Lands v.

The case could be determined on the strength of their evidence\nwithout trying to compel the defendant to bring an action for title to the land in dispute. It is for the\nplaintiff to prove title, if anyone does.

It may turn out that the party\ncomplaining was to blame, or had acquiesced in the irregularity; or that it was trivial; in which case the\nappeal court may not think fit to set aside the judgment. A defect in procedure is not always fatal.\n\u00a0\nTo revert to the portions of record quoted above.\u00a0the\u00a0Native Court, the instead of having a full re-\nhearing, had the evidence of the former witnesses read out, and heard only witnesses from the other\nsub-families. That was a defect in procedure; neither party complained of it in the subsequent appeals.\nThe re-hearing was not a nullity on that account.\n\u00a0\nIf it was a nullity, it would be, under condition (3) of the above statement on competence, on the\nground that the District Officer's order, which initiated the re-hearing, was bad in law. The order was in\nthese terms\n\u00a0\nI set aside the judgment of the Court below and order that the case be re-opened to enable witnesses\nto be called from the other two sub\u00adfamilies of\u00a0Umuonala.\n\u00a0\nIf that means that the re-hearing is to be confined to witnesses from those sub-families, the order is\nbad; if it means that there is to be a re-hearing for the sake of enabling such witnesses to be heard but\ndoes not confine it to them, it is not bad.\n\u00a0\nIt may be suggested that the order is ambiguous and should be interpreted in the light of the\nparagraph which precedes it; but that is itself ambiguous and in my view cannot have any real weight.\nFor my part I think that the order should be interpreted in the light of the\nmaxim\u00a0ut\u00a0res\u00a0magis\u00a0valeat,\u00a0and the second meaning which saves the order, should be adopted.\nMoreover, it was so understood by the Native Court to which it was addressed: at the outset that court\nhad the former evidence read out, presumably as a method of incorporating it and of saving itself\nfrom hearing it again.\n5/7/25, 1:09 PM\nGabriel Madukolu &Others v Johnson Nkemdilim (F.S.C. 344/1960 ) [1962] NGSC 4 (11 November 1962) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/1962/4/eng@1962-11-11\n8/16\n\u00a0\nI therefore think that the re-hearing was not a nullity. At the same time I should add that as the point\narose incidentally\u00a0ex improvise,\u00a0it was not argued at all fully and no cases were cited.\n\u00a0\nThat is why I dealt with it without citing any cases. There are plenty of them, both local and English,\nand some day, if the point is raised in an appeal, it will no doubt be better argued and decided.\n\u00a0\nInterest\u00a0reipublicae\u00a0ut\u00a0sit finis\u00a0litium,\u00a0is the reason behind\u00a0res\u00a0judicata.\u00a0The parties have spent an\ninordinate amount of money over a piece of land of about 100 feet by 50 at a village, and it is time\nthat the litigation was at an end.\n\u00a0\nThe following order is proposed:\n\u00a0\nThe appeal from the order of the High Court of the Eastern Region dated the 23rd November, 1959, in\nAppeal No. 0/35/A1959 of the Onitsha Judicial Division, is dismissed, with costs to the respondent,\nwhich will be assessed after hearing the parties.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJudgement\u00a0delivered by\nSir Lionel Brett.\u00a0F.J.\n\u00a0\nI have had the opportunity of reading the judgment which has been delivered by\u00a0Bairamian,\u00a0F.J., and I\nconcur in the proposal to dismiss the appeal. I\u00a0recognise\u00a0the force of the argument that on their most\nnatural interpretation the words used by the District Officer in ordering the case to be \"re-opened\"\namount to an order which he had no power to make, and that may well be the interpretation which he\nintended them to bear, but I agree with\u00a0Bairamian,\u00a0F.J., in the view that the words are capable of\nbearing the meaning which the Native Court in fact put upon them and which saves the order from\ninvalidity, and I also agree that this Court will not be departing from the accepted principles of\nconstruction in holding that that is their true meaning.\n\u00a0\nI would only add that if the order for the case to be re-opened was invalid it would follow from the\ndecision of this Court in\u00a0Ude\u00a0v.\u00a0Agu\u00a0(1961) All\u00a0N.L.R.\u00a065, that the order setting aside the previous\njudgment of the Native Court was invalid also, since \"a naked power to set aside judgments is not\nprovided for by section 40\" of the former Native Courts Ordinance. Mr\u00a0Shyngle\u00a0did not submit that the\nprevious judgment constituted\u00a0res\u00a0judicata\u00a0in his\u00a0favour, and on the view which I take of the effect of\nthe order it is unnecessary for me to express an opinion on whether the point would now be open to\nthe appellants.\n\u00a0\n5/7/25, 1:09 PM\nGabriel Madukolu &Others v Johnson Nkemdilim (F.S.C. 344/1960 ) [1962] NGSC 4 (11 November 1962) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/1962/4/eng@1962-11-11\n9/16\n\u00a0\nDissenting\u00a0Judgement\u00a0delivered by\nJohn\u00a0Idowu\u00a0Conrad Taylor.\u00a0F.J\n\u00a0\nThe plaintiffs sued the defendant in the Native Court of\u00a0Mbateghete\u00a0for a declaration of title to land\nknown as \"Aniuno-Isigwu\". In giving Judgment on the\u00a0llth\u00a0August, 1958, the Court held as follows:\n\u00a0\nWe have every reason to believe that the land belongs to the plaintiffs. We therefore find the land for\nthe plaintiffs because the title has now been proved beyond all doubts.\n\u00a0\nAgainst this Judgment the defendant appealed to the County Court Grade \"A\", which held as follows:\n\u00a0\nThe Plaintiffs/Respondents have made out their title case against the defendant-appellant but so far\nthe defendant is occupying the compound\u00a0land,\u00a0we are awarding the Plaintiffs/Respondents a\nReversionary Title.\n\u00a0\nA further appeal was lodged by the defendant to the Magistrate's Court\u00a0holden\u00a0at\u00a0Awka, and on the\n23 \u00a0day of May, 1959, the Learned Magistrate confirmed the decision of the County Court and\ndismissed the appeal. Although the effect of a previous Suit No. 33/56 in the previous proceedings\nwas dealt with in the other Courts and evidence led about that Suit, it is in the Magistrate's Court that\nwe find the legal effect of that Suit dealt with. The Magistrate held,\u00a0inter alia,\u00a0that:\n\u00a0\nIt is also not correct that the matter is\u00a0res\u00a0judicata.\u00a0The claim in the suit No. 33/56 was for recovery of\nRent and the Administrative Officer with Resident's Judicial Powers found that plaintiff has failed to\nprove title to the land on which defendant\u00a0has his house. On this and on some other grounds he\ndismissed the claim. The Deputy Governor condemned his judgment. It will be noted that he did not\nfind that the land does not belong to the plaintiff: all he said was that the plaintiff failed to prove his\ntitle which in that case the plaintiff was not out to do.\n\u00a0\nThe defendant appealed further to the High Court, which on the 23rd November, 1959, allowed the\nappeal and set aside the decisions of the Courts below. The Learned Judge on appeal held,\u00a0inter\nalia,\u00a0that:\n\u00a0\nThe Respondents base their claim to a declaration of title on the alleged tenancy; if they fail in proving\na tenancy, they also fail in asserting their title; they have failed in proving alleged tenancy because the\nissues decided in a suit as between the same parties are conclusive and cannot be a matter of further\nlitigation between them\u00a0(Outram\u00a0v.\u00a0Morewood,\u00a03 East, 346, 355, 358, and\u00a0Priestman\u00a0v.\nThomas,\u00a09\u00a0P.D.\u00a070, 210).\nrd\n5/7/25, 1:09 PM\nGabriel Madukolu &Others v Johnson Nkemdilim (F.S.C. 344/1960 ) [1962] NGSC 4 (11 November 1962) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/1962/4/eng@1962-11-11\n10/16\n\u00a0\nThe judgment is not only conclusive with reference to the actual matter decided but to the grounds\nfor the decision.\n\u00a0\nThe plaintiffs have appealed to this Court from the Judgment of the High Court of the Onitsha\nDivision. In addition to the general grounds of appeal against the evidence, two additional grounds\nwere filed and argued with leave of this Court, and they read thus:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Learned Judge misdirected himself when he said at page 39, line 19 of the record that \"the\nrespondents base their claim to a declaration of title on the alleged tenancy; if they fail in proving a\ntenancy, they also fail in asserting their title;\"\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Learned Judge in the Court below is wrong in law when he held that the issue of tenancy\nraised in the\u00a0Mbateghete\u00a0Native Court Suit 33/1956 is\u00a0res\u00a0judicata.\n\u00a0\nI think it is important at the outset to look at Suit No. 33/56 and to decide what effect it has on the\ncase on appeal before us. In that Suit the\u00a0present\u00a0 \u00a0appellants sued the present respondent for the\nfollowing:\n\u00a0\nRecovery of 195 yams, 13 fowls, 13 pots of palm wine and 13 Kola-nuts being the customary land\nrental due from defendant for 13 years. The lease having been granted for building purposes in 1941\nout of which the defendant satisfied the conditions for 2 years only and has since failed. Total cash\nvalue of rental - \u00a320.\n\u00a0\nThe Native Court gave Judgment for the plaintiff for the sum of \u00a320, being arrears of rent. There are\nother portions of the Judgment which deal with title to the area in dispute and which were the subject\nmatter of adverse comment in later proceedings, but I do not for the moment consider them relevant\nfor the point to which I am leading. This Judgment went on appeal before the District Officer. He\nheard it as an appeal and made the following order:\n\u00a0\nI study the record and consider that Court should have called as Court's witnesses the two remaining\nsub-families of\u00a0Umuonala\u00a0family. The case could be determined on the strength of their evidence\nwithout trying to compel the defendant to bring an action for title to the land in dispute. It is for the\nplaintiff to prove title, if anyone does. The appeal succeeds.\n\u00a0\nI set aside the judgment of the Court below and order that the case be re-opened to enable witnesses\nto be called from the other two sub\u00adfamilies of\u00a0Umuonala.\n\u00a0\n;\n5/7/25, 1:09 PM\nGabriel Madukolu &Others v Johnson Nkemdilim (F.S.C. 344/1960 ) [1962] NGSC 4 (11 November 1962) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/1962/4/eng@1962-11-11\n11/16\nThe case went back to the Native Court, and a Bench consisting of three at of the five Judges who\ndelivered Judgment, and four who sat over the case when it began on the 6th July, 1956, re-opened\nthe case on the 17th September, 1956, as ordered by the District Officer. On the 8 \u00a0October, 1956,\nwhen further evidence was heard, this Bench had increased to five. The record, when the case was\nreopened, reads as follows:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe Record of proceedings in the previous hearing read and interpreted before the hearing of the\nbench.\u00a0The District Officer's remarks also read.\n\u00a0\n\"Q. by Court to plaintiff:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What are the names of those two families whose evidence are required in\nthis case?\n\u00a0\nAns.:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They are known as\u00a0Umuonemum\u00a0and\u00a0Akpoadimora.\n\u00a0\nThe witnesses were than called as well as some others called by the Court, at the end of which the\nrecord reads as follows:\n\u00a0\nWe have reheard the case and also heard new witnesses\u00a0produced ...\n\u00a0\nAt the hearing of this appeal I brought this matter to the notice of Mr\u00a0Sofola\u00a0for the respondent\nand\u00a0Shyngle\u00a0for the appellants, as I thought the order of the District Officer was one he was not\nempowered by law to make and therefore a matter affecting his jurisdiction. It is true that a full dress\nargument did not develop on the point. Mr\u00a0Sofola\u00a0contended that the proceedings in Suit 33/56 were\nnot a nullity as the\u00a0res\u00a0was not affected. References were also made to ss. 33 and 40 of the Native\nCourts Ordinance, Cap.\u00a0142, Vol. 4 of the 1948 Laws of Nigeria.\u00a0Mr\u00a0Shyngle\u00a0on the other hand\ncontended that once the District Officer had no power to send a case back for further evidence to be\ntake the whole proceedings are a nullity, and that that was a matter which could be taken in this\nappeal.\n\u00a0\nI shall first deal with the question as to whether this was a matter that could be taken up by the\nAppeal Court itself. Order VII, rule 2(6) of the Federal Supreme Court Rules provides that:\n\u00a0\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions the Court in deciding the appeal shall not be confined to\nthe grounds set forth by the appellant:\n\u00a0\nProvided that the Court shall not if it allows the appeal rest its decision on any ground not set forth by\nthe appellant unless the respondent has had sufficient opportunity of contesting the cause on that\nth\n5/7/25, 1:09 PM\nGabriel Madukolu &Others v Johnson Nkemdilim (F.S.C. 344/1960 ) [1962] NGSC 4 (11 November 1962) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/1962/4/eng@1962-11-11\n12/16\nground.\n\u00a0\nAs I said earlier in this judgment, Counsel for both sides were invited by me to adduce arguments on\nthis point, and though there was no full dress argument, neither Counsel sought for an adjournment\nwith a view to making preparations for a more detailed argument.\n\u00a0\nThe Judgment of the Learned Judge in the Court below rests on the point that the decision in Suit\n33/1956 is\u00a0res\u00a0judicata,\u00a0and Learned Counsel for the appellants has filed grounds of appeal attacking\nthe judgment and the finding of\u00a0res\u00a0judicata.\u00a0In my view if it becomes apparent on the record that a\njudgment which is relied on as\u00a0res\u00a0judicata\u00a0is in fact a nullity through excess or lack of Jurisdiction, it is\nthe duty of trial and an Appeal Court of its own motion to take up the point provided opportunity is\ngiven to both sides to adduce arguments on the issue.\n\u00a0\nIn the case of\u00a0Westminister\u00a0Bank Ltd. v. Edwards,\u00a0(1942)\u00a0A.C.\u00a0529,\u00a0Viscount Simon, L.C.,\u00a0says this at page\n533:\n\u00a0\nMoreover, the question was not in issue. There are of course, cases in which a Court should itself take\nan objection of its own, even though the point is not raised by any parties to it.\n\u00a0\nAfter giving certain instances of when this may be done, the judgment continues thus:\n\u00a0\nAgain, a Court not only may, but should, take objection where the absence of jurisdiction is apparent\non the face of the proceedings. Thus an appellate Court not only may, but must, take objection that it\nhas no jurisdiction to hear an appeal if it is apparent that no right of appeal exists.\n\u00a0\nLord Wright,\u00a0at page 536 of the same report, says this:\n\u00a0\nNow it is clear that a Court is not entitled but bound to put an end to proceedings if at any stage and\nby any means it becomes manifest that they are incompetent. It can do so of its own initiative, even\nthough the parties have consented to the irregularity, because as\u00a0Willes, J., said in\u00a0City of London\nCorporation v. Cox\u00a0(3) in the course of giving the answers of the Judges to this House,\n\u00a0\n\"mere\u00a0acquiescence does not give jurisdiction.\"\n\u00a0\nIn\u00a0Farquharson\u00a0v.

The Court must protect the prerogative of the Crown and the due course of the\nadministration of Justice by prohibiting the inferior Court from proceeding in matters as to which it is\napparent that it has no jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\nThat was a case of prohibition, but I think the general principle applies equally to the duty of the Court\nto take the objection when it becomes apparent in the course of proceedings before it in an appeal.\n\u00a0\nThe words of\u00a0Lord Wright\u00a0in the passage to which I have referred are very strong indeed\n\u00a0\n\"at\u00a0any stage and by any means\".\n\u00a0\nI now turn to the order of the District Officer, for if he acted in excess of the jurisdiction given him by\nthe Native Courts Ordinance, if he had no power to make the order which he in fact made, then that\norder is a nullity, and no matter what happened subsequently in the Native Court, no matter what the\nparties may have agreed upon, the proceedings subsequent to the order are a nullity.\n\u00a0\nNow the\u00a0power of the District Officer on hearing an appeal are\u00a0contained in s. 40 of the aforesaid\nOrdinance, which reads thus:\n\u00a0\nA Native Court of Appeal, a Magistrate's Court, the High Court, a District Officer, a Resident or the\nGovernor in the exercise of his appellate jurisdiction under this Ordnance may\n\u00a0\n(a)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0after rehearing the whole case or not, make any such Order or pass any such Sentence as the\nCourt of first instance could have made or passed in such cause or matter;\n\u00a0\n(b)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0order\u00a0any such cause or matter to be reheard before the Court of first instance or before any\nother native court or before any Magistrate's Court.\n\u00a0\nIt is with s. 40(b) that we are here concerned, for the District Officer never reheard the case.

It is apparent from the extracts of the parties\u0000 pleadings that the appellants traced their title to\ntheir ancestor BAMIGBOLA who was said to have been granted the land in dispute by Oba Adegboye\nAtoloye, the Olofa of Ofatedo who himself received the grant of the land from the then Olubadan of\nIbadan. The appellants claimed to be in possession of the land in dispute and that the respondent came\nto disturb their possession when in 1982 he came on the land and erected sign posts thereon. The\nrespondent on the other hand claimed that he had been in possession of the land since 1975 when he\npurchased it from Oba John Laoye, the Timi of Ede whose ancestor Oba Timi Ajeniju acquired the land\nby conquest 200 years ago. It was pleaded that the Olofa of Ofatedo whose title the appellants relied\nupon was in fact a tenant to the Timi of Ede. The learned trial Judge dismissed the relief for declaration\nof title. He however granted the relief for trespass. He awarded nominal damages and granted\ninjunction in favour of the appellants. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was allowed. That court set\naside the award of damages for trespass and injunction granted in favour of the appellants. Aggrieved\nthe appellants appealed to the Supreme Court. Appeal allowed. The Supreme Court held that the Court\nof Appeal was wrong to have set aside the judgment in favour of the appellant as the appellant\u0000s\ncustomary tenancy is perpetual unless terminated by an order of forfeiture.\nISSUES\nWhether the Court of Appeal was right to have set aside the finding of the trial Court on possession and\nthe status of the Plaintiffs which entitled them to be in possession and to maintain an action for\ntrespass against the defendant.\nMATTERS CONSIDERED\nv A trespasser in possession of land can maintain an action in trespass against all persons except the\ntrue owner\nv On customary tenancy \u0096 a customary tenant is always in possession: in perpetuity, unless and until the\ntenancy is forfeited \u0096 courts are reluctant to grant forfeiture and only do so where the tenant alienates\na portion of the land without the prior consent of the overlord; by denying the title of the overlord, or\nby using the land for purposes other than those agreed upon.

See Amakor v. Obiefuna (Reprint) where this court\nper Fatayi Williams JSC (as he then was) said \"....... a trespasser in possession of land, as against\neveryone but the true owner, can devise or convey his interest in the land or transmit it by\ninheritance (see Asher v. Whitlock. In this connection, we refer, with approval, to the statement\nof Cockburn, C.J., at page 5 of the judgment in the Asher case. It reads ?But I take it as clearly\nestablished, that possession is good against all the world except the person who can show a\ngood title; and it would be mischievous to change this established doctrine. Doe v. Dyeball Mood\nand M 346, one year\u0000s possession by the plaintiff was held good against a person who came and\nturned him out; and there are other authorities to the same effect. Suppose the person who\noriginally inclosed the land had been expelled by the defendant, or the defendant had obtained\npossession without force, by simply walking in at the open door in the absence of the then\npossessor, and were to say to him, ?you have no more title than I have, my possession is as good\nas yours,\u0000 surely ejectment could have been maintained by the original possessor against the\ndefendant.? ?It only remains for us to add that, on the authority above an original trespasser as\nagainst every one but the true owner, can, if he is in exclusive possession of the land, maintain an\naction in trespass against a later trespasser whose possession, whether taken by force or not,\nwould be clearly adverse to that of the original trespasser. Therefore, assuming, without\ndeciding, that the plaintiff/appellant in the case in hand is also an original trespasser, it seems to\nus that he can maintain an action for trespass against the defendant/respondent who has\ndisturbed his possession.\" \u0096 Per Oguntade, JSC (Pg. 160 - 161)\n(b) A person in possession can bring an action against a person in trespass. This is because the\nact of trespass physically injures the rights of the person in possession. Therefore a plaintiff who\nis in possession has a legal right to commence an action against a defendant who is in trespass of\nthe land. In other words, a person in possession can commence or maintain an action in trespass\nagainst any person other than the person who can establish better title. Am I repeating myself? I\nthink not. See Onveakaoru v. Ekwubiri; Amakor v. Obiefuna. \u0096 Per Niki Tobi, JSC (Pg. 168)\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0On customary tenancy \u0000 a customary tenant is always in possession: in perpetuity, unless and until\nthe tenancy is forfeited \u0000 courts are reluctant to grant forfeiture and only do so where the tenant alienates\na portion of the land without the prior consent of the overlord; by denying the title of the overlord, or by\nusing the land for purposes other than those agreed upon. Neither the overlord nor his successor in-title\ncould dispossess a customary tenant, except it be by means of an action for forfeiture \u0096 This case falls on\nall fours with Lasisi v. Tubi, where this Court per Dan Ibekwe JSC stated the position of the law on\ncustomary tenancy as follows : ?We wish to begin by emphasizing the fact that, under our law,\nthe customary tenant enjoys a most enviable position. Once in possession, he is always in\npossession; for, time does not run against him. It is settled law that the possessory right of a\ncustomary tenant goes on and on, in perpetuity, unless and until the tenancy is forfeited. Be it\nnoted also that the courts in this country are very slow in granting forfeiture. Indeed, it will be\nmore correct to say that, in so far as customary tenancy is concerned, our courts have always\nbeen willing and ready to grant a relief against forfeiture, except in an extreme case, where the\nrefusal to grant it would tend to defeat the ends of justice. But such cases are few and far\nbetween. They are, therefore, very difficult to come by in our law reports. The theory behind the\nconcept of our customary tenancy is that where strangers or immigrants have been granted land\nfor occupation and use, they are entitled to continue in peaceable enjoyment until they forfeit\ntheir rights on such grounds as, e.g. alienating a portion of the land to others without the prior\nconsent of the grantors, or by putting the land to uses other than those originally agreed upon,\nor by failure to pay the customary tribute, or by denying the title of the overlord. The list is not\n5/7/25, 1:15 PM\nBELLO SALAMI & Another v ALHAJI ADETORO LAWAL (SC 417/2001) [2008] NGSC 1 (10 July 2008) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2008/1/eng@2008-07-10\n3/10\nexhaustive, though it is important to observe that it is also well-established that customary\ntenants should not suffer forfeiture for minor acts of misbehaviour, and that the courts are loath\nto order forfeiture except in the most exceptional circumstances. See Ashagbon v. Oduntan, and\nOgbakumanwu & Ors. v. Chiabolo, It is therefore obvious that, neither the overlord, nor his\nsuccessor-in-title, could dispossess a customary tenant, except it be by means of an action for\nforfeiture. It is, of course, always open to the customary tenant to abandon his tenancy if he so\ndesires, but that is another matter. We think that we should point out here that customary\ntenancy has no equivalent in English law. It is neither a lease-hold interest nor a tenancy at will,\nnor a yearly tenancy. The main incident of such tenure is the payment of tribute, not rents, by the\ncustomary tenant to the overlord. \u0096 Per Oguntade, JSC (Pg. 161 - 162)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A customary tenant remains in possession in perpetuity provided he is of good behaviour \u0096 It is no\nlonger in doubt that a customary tenant remains in possession in perpetuity, provided that he is\nof good behaviour see Ejeanalonye & Ors. v. Omabuike & Ors. where this court put the law\nsuccinctly as follows:- '.......... .The customary tenant pays tribute and enjoys perpetuity of tenure\nsubject to good behaviour, which means in practice that he may forfeit his holding only as a\nresult of an order of court for forfeiture at the instance of the customary landlords.\u0000 \u0096 Per\nOguntade, JSC (Pg. 162)\n4.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0A purchaser of an overlord's radical title only acquires title as possession at all times is reposed in the\ncustomary tenant until and unless same is forfeited \u0096 It therefore follows that, whoever deludes\nhimself into purchasing the overlord\u0000s radical title will soon discover that he has to take the land\nas he finds it. Such purchaser might have acquired title, but never in the least, possession which,\nat all times, is reposed in the customary tenant until forfeited.\" And at page 67, the learned JSC\nadded: \"We think that we should also draw attention to the fact, that as far as the customary\ntenant is concerned, the question of title seems to be academic. As a matter of fact, the\ncustomary tenant is concerned only with possession simpliciter which, in the absence of any\nmisbehaviour on his part, is indefeasible. It is also pertinent to stress the fact that a purchaser\nfrom the overlord will simply step into the shoes of the vendor. The rule is \u0093Nemo dat quod non\nhabel\" \u0096 \"no one gives what he does not have\" in other words, a purchaser can never get what\nthe vendor himself did not possess. We accordingly take the view that just as the overlords, the\nOloto Chieftancy Family, are without power to dispossess the customary tenants in the present\ncase so also their successors-in-title (the respondents) are completely devoid of any such right. In\nshort, we are of the view that the respondents in the present case bought the disputed land,\nsubject to the unextinguished possessory title of the appellants - the customary tenants.\" \u0096 Per\nOguntade, JSC (Pg. 162 - 163)\n5.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0There is no provision in the Supreme Court rules for sub-issues \u0000innovations not consistent with court\nrules are not acceptable \u0096 The first comment I want to make is on the Brief of the appellants. It is a\nBrief of one issue made up of what counsel calls sub-issues. They are four in number. I do not\nknow sub-issue in a Brief. I know issue; not sub-issue. There is no provision in Order 6 of the\nSupreme Court Rules for sub-issues. I shall therefore take the sub-issues as part of the main\nIssue. I do hope that counsel will not involve himself in such an innovation that is not known to\nour Rules of Court. I have no objection for counsel introducing innovations in our system if they\nare consistent with our rules of court. I certainly have objection if innovations are not consistent\nwith our rules of court. \u0096 Per Niki Tobi, JSC (Pg. 167)\n6.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0On the five ways of proving title to land \u0096 There are five ways of proving title to or ownership of\nland. They are: (1) By traditional evidence. (2) By production of documents of title duly\nauthenticated and executed. (3) By acts of ownership, extending over a sufficient length of time\nnumerous and positive enough as to warrant the inference of true ownership. (4) By acts of long\npossession and enjoyment. (5) Proof of possession of connected or adjacent land in\ncircumstances rendering it probable that the owner of such connected or adjacent land would, in\naddition, be the owner of the land in dispute.

Okumagba; Omoregbe v.\n5/7/25, 1:15 PM\nBELLO SALAMI & Another v ALHAJI ADETORO LAWAL (SC 417/2001) [2008] NGSC 1 (10 July 2008) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2008/1/eng@2008-07-10\n4/10\nIdugiemwanve; Mogaji v. Cadburv (Nigeria) Ltd.; Ezeoke v. Nwagbo; Fasaro v. Beyioku; Okpuruwu\nv. Chief Okpokam. \u0000 Per Niki Tobi, JSC (Pg. 167)\n7.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For possession to suffice as proof of title to land same must be for a long period of time \u0000 For\npossession of adjacent or connecting lands to suffice the two pieces of land must be very close \u0096\nPossession per se may not be proof of ownership. The possession must be long and the length of\nthe period will be determined in the light of the facts of each case. Apart from the long\npossession, a plaintiff can prove ownership of the land in dispute if he proves possession of land\nconnected or adjacent to the land in dispute. The plaintiff must prove proximity of the two\npieces of land. He must prove some nexus or contiguity. Where the pieces of land are kilometers\napart or away, a trial Judge will not give judgment to the plaintiff. Again, the connection or\nadjacent nature of the two pieces of land will be determined by the facts of each case. Plaintiff\nmust prove that the two pieces of land are very close; they touch or almost touch each other.\nThey must join or in relation substantially or materially; not necessarily like Siamese twins. \u0096 Per\nNiki Tobi, JSC (Pg. 168)\n8.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Possession of property means the occupation or physical control of the parcel of land either personally\nor through an agent or servant of the claimant \u0096 Possession of property or parcel of land means the\noccupation or physical control of the property or parcel of land either personally or through an\nagent or servant of the claimant.

OGUNTADE, JSC (Lead Judgment): The appellants were the plaintiffs at the Oshogbo High Court of\nOsun State where they claimed against the respondent as the defendant the following reliefs:\n\"(i) A declaration that the Plaintiffs are the persons entitled to a statutory Right of Occupancy to the\npiece or parcel of land consisting of an area approximately 9.865 hectares, verged Blue and shown on\nplan No. OMS/OS/MISC/08/91 drawn by E.O.

The appellants\ncalled five witnesses including the 2nd appellant. Similarly, five witnesses including the defendant\ntestified in support of the defence case. In a well-written judgment delivered on 17-03-74, the trial\njudge concluded as follows:\n\"The conclusion I have therefore reached in this case is that by entering the land in dispute to erect a\nsignboard thereon, the defendant has committed an act of trespass against the Plaintiffs\u0000 exclusive\n5/7/25, 1:15 PM\nBELLO SALAMI & Another v ALHAJI ADETORO LAWAL (SC 417/2001) [2008] NGSC 1 (10 July 2008) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2008/1/eng@2008-07-10\n5/10\npossession of the said land. The Plaintiffs have however claimed N5,000.00 as general damages for the\ntrespass committed by the defendant. It is well known that in the absence of any special damages\narising from the trespass committed only nominal damages could be awarded in the form of general\ndamages. I would therefore allow N5,000.00 as general damages. Since the Plaintiffs are entitled as\ncustomary tenants to remain in possession, I think there is a need to protect their possession, of the\nland in dispute until their customary tenancy is properly determined. I would therefore grant the order\nof injunction sought. In the result, the Plaintiffs\u0000 claims succeed in part and they are hereby granted\nN5,000.00 as general damages for the trespass committed by the defendant on the land in dispute and\nan order of injunction restraining the defendant, his servants, or agents from further acts of trespass on\nthe land in dispute while the customary tenancy of the plaintiffs subsists.\"\nThe respondent was dissatisfied with the judgment of the trial court. He brought an appeal against it\nbefore the Court of Appeal, Ibadan (hereinafter referred to as ?the Court below\u0000). Before the court\nbelow, the three issues submitted by both parties to the court for determination are:\n\"(1) Whether the trial (sic) judge was not wrong in holding that the plaintiffs action for declaration of\ntitle to statutory right of occupancy is respect of the parcel of land in dispute;\n(2) Whether the Learned trial Judge had not committed error of law in holding that the previous\ndecision by the Supreme Court in respect of the same parcel of land between the same parties did not\nconstitute estoppel.\n(3)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Whether learned trial judge was not wrong in holding that the Plaintiffs had LOCUS STANDI to\ninstitute the suit against the defendant.?\nThe Court below in its judgment on 14-06-01 held:\n\"As Respondents failed to establish lawful and cogent evidence of possession, the finding of fact of\npossession was perverse and hereby set aside. As damages for trespass is rooted in possession which\nRespondents failed to establish, the Order for damages for trespass for the sum of N5,000.00 as general\ndamages is hereby set aside, so also the order of injunction which is granted at the discretion of the\nCourt acting judicially and judiciously.\"\nThe Court below in effect allowed the respondent\u0000s appeal and set aside the judgment in favour of the\nappellants. The appellants were dissatisfied with the judgment of the court below. They have come\nbefore this court on a final appeal against the said judgment. In their appellants\u0000 brief, the solitary issue\nfor determination in this appeal was identified to be:\n\"Whether the Court of Appeal was right to have set aside the finding of the trial Court on possession\nand the status of the Plaintiffs which entitled them to be in possession and to maintain an action for\ntrespass against the defendant.\"\nThe respondent in his brief formulated the issue for determination in the appeal differently thus:\n\"Whether the learned Justices of the Court of Appeal were not right in upholding the Respondent (sic)\nappeal before it when the appellants evidence of possession on which the claims for damages and\nInjunction were granted by the trial Court were found not to be rooted in the traditional history of title\nas pleaded.\"\nIn the consideration of the single issue for determination in this appeal, I intend to consider\npreliminarily the pleadings upon which the case was tried.\nThe appellants pleaded in their Further Amended Statement of claim that the land in dispute was\ngranted to their ancestor BAMIGBOLA by OBA ADEGBOYE ATOLOYE, the Olofa of Ofatedo over two\nhundred years ago.

In\nparagraphs 21-23 of the Further Amended Statement of claim, the appellants pleaded thus:\n\"(21) The Plaintiffs and members of their family are still farming on the land in dispute, planting cocoa,\nkola nuts, oranges and other crops like yams, cassava, sweet potatoes without any hindrance or\ndisturbance from anyone until 1982.\n(22)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0The Plaintiffs are the descendants of their ancestors called BAMIGOLA and they derived their\nrespective inheritance titles under Native Law and Custom.\n(23)\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Sometime in 1982 the Defendant visited the land in dispute and started erection of sign posts on\nthe land, the 2nd plaintiff uprooted the sign posts and 2nd Plaintiff together with others were charged\nto the Senior Magistrate\u0000s Court, Ede. In charge Number MED/6C/83 the 2nd plaintiff pleaded not\nguilty and after the trial he was fined a sum of Nl00.00 which fine was paid by the 2nd Plaintiff.\"\nThe Respondent in paragraphs 6, 9, 10, a and b, 22 and 24 of his Further Amended Statement of\ndefence, pleaded thus:\n\"(6) With further reference to paragraph 7 of the Amended statement of claim, the Defendant states\nthat the Olofa of Ofatedo is a Tenant of the Timi of Ede and has got no right to grant land without the\nknowledge and consent of the Timi of Ede.\n(9) With further reference to paragraphs 9, 10, and 11 of the Amended Statement of claim the\nDefendant avers that the land in dispute forms part of a larger area of land acquired by conquest by\nTimi Ajeniju about 200 years ago.\n10(a) That since the conquest referred to above, the Timi of Ede (Timi Ajeniju) and all other succeeding\nTimis became owners of all parcel of land in Ede and District or what is now known as Ede and\nEgbedore Local Government Areas;\n10(b) Timi Ajeniju settled many people as customary tenants parts of the conquered Areas such as Awo,\nIwoye, Ara, Oloki, Iddo-Osun, Ofatedo, Okinni, etc.\n(22) With reference to paragraph 28 of the statement of claim, the Defendant avers that he had been\nthe owner long before 1982 and that the Plaintiffs are duly aware of the Defendant\u0000s ownership of the\nland in dispute.\n\u00a0\n(24) With reference to paragraph 30 of the Statement of claim the Defendant states that he had been in\npossession since he bought the land in dispute from Oba John Laoye in 1975 or thereabout.\"\nIt is apparent from the extracts of the parties\u0000 pleadings above that the appellants traced their title to\ntheir ancestor BAMIGBOLA who was said to have been granted the land in dispute by Oba Adegboye\nAtoloye, the Olofa of Ofatedo who himself received the grant of the land from the then Olubadan of\nIbadan. The appellants claimed to be in possession of the land in dispute and that the respondent came\nto disturb their possession when in 1982 he came on the land and erected sign posts thereon. The\nrespondent on the other hand claimed that he had been in possession of the land since 1975 when he\npurchased it from Oba John Laoye, the Timi of Ede whose ancestor Oba Timi Ajeniju acquired the land\nby conquest 200 years ago. It was pleaded that the Olofa of Ofatedo whose title the appellants relied\nupon was in fact a tenant to the Timi of Ede.\nOn this state of pleadings, the trial court needed to determine the party whose traditional history was\nsuperior to the other, and the tangential question as to who of the parties was in possession of the\nland. It must be stated here that the respondent did not file a counter-claim. He merely came to defend\nthe appellants\u0000 suit.\n5/7/25, 1:15 PM\nBELLO SALAMI & Another v ALHAJI ADETORO LAWAL (SC 417/2001) [2008] NGSC 1 (10 July 2008) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2008/1/eng@2008-07-10\n7/10\nThe trial judge in his judgment came to the conclusion that the appellants did not call satisfactory\nevidence in support of the traditional history they pleaded. He dismissed the 1st leg of their claims\nwhich was for a declaration of title. As to the person who was in possession of the land in dispute, the\ntrial judge at pages 61 - 62 of the record found as follows:\n\u00a0\"The Clear evidence before the Court which I accept (and this much was admitted in the document\nExhibit 'H\u0000 and recognized in the Judgments Exhibits 'E\u0000 and 'F\u0000) is that the Ofatedo people (including\nthe plaintiffs) have all along been in exclusive possession of a much larger area of land (of which the\nland in dispute forms part) as customary tenants of the Timi of Ede.\nIndeed this was the case made out for the Defendant in his pleadings. That being the case the Plaintiffs\nfamily were lawfully in exclusive possession of the land in dispute as customary tenants, although the\ntitle to the reversion remained vested in the Timi of Ede as their customary landlord. It is trite law that\ncustomary tenants are, subject to good behaviour entitle to enjoy their use and possession of the land\nin perpetuity until forfeited by order of Court, (see Owoade v. Omitola (1985) N.W.L.R. 1 at page 9\nNwawuba and Othoera v. Eremuo and others (1988) 5 S.C.N.J. 154 at page 168 and Abioye v.\nYakubu (1991) 5 N.W.L.R. (Pt 190) 130 at pages 201 - 202. It is pertinent to emphasise that even\nwhere a customary tenant is alleged to have committed an act amounting to misbehaviour it does not\nnecessarily follow that his tenancy would automatically be forfeited. There is the need for the customary\nlandlord to institute appropriate proceedings in Court for that purpose, (see Aromolaran v. Waddel\n(1958) S.C.N. L.R. 267; Abioye v. Yakubu (1991) 5N.W.L.R. (Part 190) 130 at pages 245 - 246.\nThere is no evidence that before the Timi of Ede (3rd D.W.) executed the deed of conveyance\ntransferring the title to the land in dispute to the Defendant the customary tenancy of the plaintiffs\nthereon had been properly terminated by order of Court. It follows therefore that all that the Defendant\nhad been able to obtain from the Timi of Ede by virtue of the deed of conveyance Exhibit 'D\u0000 was the\nreversionary title to the land in dispute, while the possessory title still remains vested in the Plaintiffs as\ncustomary tenants. It is therefore clear that as at the time the Defendant entered the land for the\npurpose erecting signboard thereon, the Plaintiffs were in exclusive possession thereof.\nThe principle has always been stated that a trespasser in possession of land can maintain an action in\ntrespass against all persons except the true owner or someone claiming through the true owner (see:\nAromire v. Awoyemi (1972) 1 All N.L.R. 101 at 112; Fabunmi v. Agbe (1985) 1 N.W.L.R. 299;\nMogaji v. Cabdury (1986) 2 N.W.L.R. 9 (Part 7) 393 at page 432). The exception created with regard\nto the inability to maintain an action in trespass against the true owner or someone claiming through\nthe true owner is, of course predicated on the finding that the person seeking to maintain the action is\nhimself a trespasser. It has, nevertheless been long recognized that a tenant lawfully in possession,\ncould in certain instances maintain an action in trespass against his landlord. As stated by the\nLearned author of Halsbury\u0000s Laws of England it is trespass for a landlord to levy an illegal\ndistress or having rightfully entered on the land for the purpose of distress to remain there when\nthe distress was become wrongful, (see: Halsbury\u0000s, Laws of England (3rd Edition) Vol. 38 page\n741 paragraph 1206. Afortiori, a person claiming through a customary landlord, who unlawfully\npurported to have terminated or forfeited the interests of the customary tenant in the land and\nproceeded to enforce the illegal forfeiture or termination by seeking to take possession of the\nland and erecting signboards thereon, has committed an act of trespass. The conclusion I have\ntherefore reached in this case is that by entering the land in dispute to erect a signboard thereon, the\ndefendant has committed an act of trespass against the Plaintiffs\u0000 exclusive possession of the said\nland.\"\nIn the extract from the passage of the trial court\u0000s judgment reproduced above, the trial judge stated\nthat the appellants were in possession of the land in dispute when the respondent entered thereon; and\nfurther, that there was evidence which he accepted that the appellants\u0000 family had been on the land as\ncustomary tenants of the Timi of Ede and further that such customary tenancy was not determined\nbefore the land was sold to the respondent. The Court below in its judgment on 14-06-01 overturned\nthe judgment of the trial court on the ground that the appellants had not in the case they made before\n5/7/25, 1:15 PM\nBELLO SALAMI & Another v ALHAJI ADETORO LAWAL (SC 417/2001) [2008] NGSC 1 (10 July 2008) - NigeriaLII\nhttps://nigerialii.org/akn/ng/judgment/ngsc/2008/1/eng@2008-07-10\n8/10\nAbout NigeriaLII\nTerms of Use\nAbout us\nContact us\nOur partners\nAfricanLII\nLaws.Africa\nLesotho Judiciary\nOther African Legal Information Institutions\nAfricanLII\nGhaLII\nthe trial court admitted that they were customary tenants of the Timi of Ede. The court below in its\njudgment said:\n\"Applying Woluchem v. Gudi 1981 5 SC 291 the finding of possession in favour of Respondents who\nnever agreed to being customary tenants of TIMI OF EDE was perverse and as an appellate court I set\naside and disturb the finding of possession in favour of Respondents and state that applying section\n135, 136 and 137 EVIDENCE ACT Cap 112, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990 that\nplaintiffs/respondents failed to establish exclusive possession as the court below found that contrary to\ntheir case to be customary tenants with reversionary interest vested in TIMI OF EDE. As Respondents\nfailed to establish lawful and cogent evidence of possession the finding of fact of possession was\nperverse and hereby set aside. As damages for trespass is rooted in possession which Respondents\nfailed to establish the order for damages for trespass for the sum of \u00a31500.00 as general damages is\nhereby set aside, so also the order of injunction which is granted at the discretion of the court acting\njudicially and judiciously.\nThe attitude of appellate court is well settled as the rule in Univesity of Lagos & Anor v. M.I. Aigoro\n(1985) 1 NWLR pt.l page 143 SC. As the grant of injunction to Respondents was based on wrong\nprinciple of law in exercise of judicial discretion an appeal court can set aside the grant based on wrong\nprinciple of law. The order of injunction granted by the lower court is set aside and the prayer refused.?\nWas the Court below right in its approach to the matter? I think not. There is no doubt that on the\npleadings, the appellants had pleaded that their ancestor BAMIGBOLA had been granted the land in\ndispute by the Olubadan of Ibadan and that they were in possession of the land in dispute as the\ndescendants of Bamigbola, their ancestor. The respondent on the other hand relied on the title of the\nTIMI OF EDE from whom he claimed to have purchased the land in 1975. He\u00a0 claimed to be in\npossession of the land. The trial court in its judgment came to the conclusion that the land in dispute\nbelonged to the Timi of Ede but that the appellants as well as all the people of Ofatedo had from\nseveral years back been the customary tenants of the Timi of Ede. As a result of these findings, the\nappellants\u0000 claim for declaration of title was dismissed.

The rationale of the doctrine is a complex of factors.

He is not an arbitrator or an independent arbiter in the sense in which a Judge is in a court or other\ntribunal whose independence and impartiality is secured and maintained by law.\"\nACTION - LEGAL PERSONALITY - Distinction between juridical personality and juristic personality\n\"Who is a natural person? It is a human person who has life and blood in him or her whether a citizen of one State or another given protection by law and\nendowed with human qualities. Who is an artificial or legal person? Usually, it is a corporation aggregate or sole. It can be created by law, e.g. University of\nIbadan Act, 1962, University of Lagos Act, 1967 or incorporated under the law, e.g. companies under the Companies Act, 1968. Corporation aggregate and\ncorporation sole have been given adequate definitions in Halsbury's Laws of England. Juridical personality is not equivalent to a juristic personality. Juridical\npersonality is acquired when the law accepts and recognizes the existence of unincorporated associations. The capacity of suing and being sued is not\nthereby given by the mere recognition and acceptance of its existence. Thus, the acceptance and recognition by (a) The Legal Practitioners Act, 1975\n(Sections 1, 3, 7, 9,11,14,22 and 23 thereof); (b) Legal Education (Consolidation etc.) Act, 1976 as amended by the Legal Education Consolidation etc. Act, 1977\n(Sections 19 and 27 thereof); (c) The Interpretation Act, 1964 (Section 2(1) thereof) (d) Item 48 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the Constitution of the\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, 1979 cannot be construed as the conferment on the Nigerian Bar Association of the capacity to sue. Only the law of the land\ncan confer that attribute or capacity and in most statute the capacity to sue and be sued of the authority or body they create is expressed.\"\nLEGAL PRACTITIONER - THE NIGERIAN BAR ASSOCIATION - Nature of the Constitution of the Nigerian Bar Association\n\"The Constitution of the Nigerian Bar Association is not a statutory instrument. It is not a subsidiary legislation to the Legal Practitioners Act. It is a pure and\nsimple private document which the members of the Nigerian Bar Association were entitled to draw up in exercise of their right to provide a constitution for\nthe Association to regulate its affairs. It was accorded its due superior position by the Legal Practitioners Act, 1975 in the conduct of the affairs of the\nNigerian Bar Association by the General Council of the Bar. This does not make the Nigerian Bar Association a juristic person. It only gives the body\nrecognition as a legal entity made up of legal practitioners. The fact that the legislature has in the Legal Practitioners Act, 1975 and the Legal Education\n(Consolidation etc.) Act, 1976 given the Nigerian Bar Association representation on the Body of Benchers and the Council of Legal Education is no indication\nthat legislature constituted the Association a suable entity.\"\nCOMPANY LAW - LEGAL PERSONALITY/JURISTIC PERSONALITY - Whether unincorporated association of persons will be deemed to have legal\npersonality\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n3/136\n\"The well settled judicial view in this country appears to me consistent in holding that an association of persons without incorporation cannot be regarded\nas a legal person for the purposes of actions in court.

So I say no more about that. As to artificial\nperson what is usually meant is a corporation, aggregate or sole. As to the definition of a corporation aggregate Halsbury's Laws of England, Volume 9, page\n4, article 3, says as follows \"A corporation aggregate has been defined as a collection of individuals united into one body under a special denomination,\nhaving perpetual succession under an artificial form, and vested by the policy of the law with the capacity of acting in several respects as an individual,\nparticularly of taking and granting property, of contracting obligations and of suing and being sued, of enjoying privileges and immunities in common, and of\nexercising a variety of political rights, more or less extensive, according to the design of its institution or the powers conferred upon it, either at the time of\nits creation or at any subsequent period of its existence.\" And as to the definition of a Corporation Sole, article 8 at page 7 of the same work says: \"A\ncorporation sole is a body politic having perpetual succession, constituted in a single person, who, in right of some office or function, has a capacity to\ntake, purchase, hold, and demise (and in some particular instances, under qualifications and restrictions introduced by statute, power to alienate) lands,\ntenements, and hereditaments, and now, it would seem, also to take and hold personal property, to him and his successors in such office for ever, the\nsuccession being perpetual, but not always uninterruptedly continuous; that is, there may be, and often are, periods in the duration of a corporation sole,\noccurring irregularly, in which there is a vacancy, or no one in existence in whom the corporation resides and is visibly represented.\"\nINTERPRETATION OF STATUTE - SECTION 6(6) (A) OF THE 1979 CONSTITUTION - Interpretation of Section 6(6)(a) of the 1979 Constitution as regards\ninherent jurisdiction of court to exercise disciplinary action over lawyers for misconduct\n\"Section 6(6)(a) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1979, which says: \"(6) The judicial powers vested in accordance with the foregoing\nprovisions of this section (a) shall extend, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Constitution, to all inherent powers and sanctions of a court of\nlaw;\" It cannot now be gainsaid that courts established by our constitution have inherent jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances to exercise disciplinary\naction over lawyers for misconduct.\"\nLEGAL PRACTITIONER - THE NIGERIAN BAR ASSOCIATION - Whether the Nigerian Bar Association is a juristic person capable of suing and being\nsued in its name\n\"The name 'Nigerian Bar Association' is not a registered name under any statute although it is recognized and accepted as the name of the body by various\nstatutes. The Nigerian Bar Association loses nothing by being declared a non juristic person. It can always sue and be sued in a representative capacity. The\nrepresentative action is always available to it and to all persons wronged by it. The various State High Court Civil Procedure Rules make provisions for\nrepresentative actions.\"\nCONSTITUTIONAL LAW - ENFORCEMENT OF FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT(S) - Instances where the fundamental rights can be waived\n\"In Ariori v. Elemo (1983) 1 S.C.N.L.R. 1 this court held as follows: (1) Fundamental rights that are for the sole benefit of the private individual can be waived.\nThese include the right to speedy trial which a litigant can waive by asking for an adjournment of the case in so far as the adjournment does not give rise to\na miscarriage of justice. (2) Fundamental rights that are for the benefit of the litigant and the public cannot be waived. These include the right to speedy\ntrial which a litigant cannot waive by seeking an adjournment if the adjournment is of such a nature that the Court will lose the advantage it has of accurate\nassessment of the witnesses it had observed in the course of trial. This is because to permit such a waiver will lead to injustice as it is against public policy\nto compromise illegality, manifest or latent.\"\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n4/136\nACTION - CAPACITY TO SUE AND BE SUED - Categories of persons who can sue and be sued in law\n\"In Okechukwu and Sons v.

After the suit was initiated,efforts were made to effect amicable settlement out of Court but\nwithout success.The 2nd to the 4th Respondent appeared for NBA. The 1st Respondent participated in the scuttled settlement meeting. The Appellant filed a motion for\nan interlocutory injunction to restrain the 2nd to 4th respondent from continued appearance for the 1st Respondent. In response, the 3rd to 5th Respondent filed an\napplication by a way of preliminary objection to the Appellant's application seeking an order striking out the name of the 1st Respondent and striking out the entire suit\non the ground that the NBA is not a juristic person and cannot sue in its name. The learned Chief Judge heard the two applications together and dismissed that of the\nRespondent, while granting the application of the Appellant.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal, the decision was reversed and \u00a0the orders of the learned Chief Judge set aside. The Appellant felt dissatisfied, and thus appealed to\nthe Supreme Court.\nISSUES:\nThe Supreme Court determined the appeal on the issues which the plaintiff/appellant stated and which the respondents adopted. They are as follows:\n\"(1) Whether the Nigerian Bar Association is a juristic person capable of suing and of being sued in its name.\n(2) Whether the Chief Judge was unjustified in barring Chief Williams, S.A.N., Mr. Molajo, S.A.N. and Mr. Sofola, S.A.N. from appearing for the Nigerian Bar Association\nconsequent upon what they did and said at the meeting of the 3rd of march, 1985 in the house of Sir Ademola.\n(3) Whether The affidavit evidence sworn to on the 29th of April, 1985 by the Appellant is inadmissible.\n(4) Whether the Appellant waived his right to object to the appearance of the three senior advocates.\"\nDECISION/HELD:\nIn the final analysis, the Supreme Court unanimously dismissed the appeal.

In\nthat ruling it was ordered that pleadings be filed in\nthe case within such a period of time to be agreed\nupon by the parties with the court's concurrence.\nThis ruling was on 16th April, 1985. Thereafter the\nplaintiff filed his Statement of Claim on the 22nd\nday of April, 1985. Later by a Motion on Notice dated\n29th April, 1985 the plaintiff moved the court for\nthe following relief:\n\"An order of interlocutory injunction restraining\nChief F. R. A. Williams, S.A.N.; Mr. Kehinde Sofola,\nS.A.N. and Mr. E. A. Molajo, S.A.N., from acting or\nfrom continuing to act or from representing or from\ncontinuing to represent the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation, the 1st Defendant in this suit on the\nground that their appearance or representation for\n13\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n7/136\nthe Nigerian Bar Association is improper,\nunprofessional, dishonourable and dishonest.\"\nIn support of the application, the plaintiff swore a\n26 paragraph affidavit. In view of the conclusion I\nhave reached in this appeal I do not think it will be\nnecessary for me to reproduce the contents of the\naffidavit in this case. What the affidavit is all about\nwill be gathered in my judgment in this appeal.\nLater by a Notice of Preliminary Objection dated\n10th May, 1985 the first person sought to be\nrestrained in the application of the plaintiff of 29th\nApril, 1985, Chief F. R. A. Williams, S.A.N. took a\npreliminary objection to the application. The Notice\nof Preliminary Objection is as follows:\n\"NOTICE OF PRELIMINARY OBJECTION\nTAKE NOTICE that at the hearing of the Motion on Notice\ndated 29th April, 1985 the 1st person named in the\nsaid Motion on Notice, namely, Chief F. R. A.\nWilliams will rely on the following preliminary\nobjection, that is to say, that the said Motion on\nNotice should be dismissed on the ground that the\nevidence in support of the prayers in the said\nMotion on Notice and the said Motion constitute a\ndeliberate abuse of the process of the Court.\nParticulars\n1. The entire affidavit evidence in support of the\nMotion on Notice is inadmissible in view of the\nprovisions of Section 25 of the Evidence Act and\nthe common law rule including the admission of\nstatement made in the course of negotiating for or\nexploring the possibility of the settlement of a\ndispute out of Court.\n14\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n8/136\n2. This Honorable Court had on a previous occasion\nruled that the evidence of matters now sworn to in\nthe affidavit mentioned in paragraph 1 hereof is\ninadmissible and the Court warned newspaper\nreporters not to publish so much of such matters as\nwere divulged in court by the plaintiff herein.\n3. Notwithstanding the ruling aforementioned, the\nplaintiff deliberately sent to the daily newspapers,\ncopies of the Motion dated 29/4/85 together with\nthe affidavit containing matters which the Court\nhad warned newspapers not to publish and the said\nmatters have been published in the Daily Times,\nthe Punch and the Tribune of 30/4/84.\n4. The motion cannot possibly have been filed in\ngood faith for the purpose of obtaining any genuine\nrelief but has been filed in all probability for the\npurpose of supplying to the press for publication,\nmatters which the court had warned the\nnewspapers not to publish and which matters are\nuntrue.\nAND FURTHER TAKE NOTICE that at the hearing of\nthis application, the objectors will rely on the\nnewspapers mentioned in paragraph 3 of the\nGrounds of Objection herein.\"\nOn the same day, that is 10th May, 1985, the 1st\nDefendant by a Motion on Notice applied to the\ncourt for the following reliefs:\n(a) striking out the name of the 1st Defendant on\nthe ground that it is not a juristic person and so\ncannot be sued;\n(b) striking out the entire action on the ground that\neven if all the facts pleaded in the Statement of\n15\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n9/136\nClaim are admitted or established, the court will\nnot grant any of the reliefs claimed in the absence\nof all proper parties to the action; and for such\nfurther and/or other orders as this Honorable Court\nmay deem fit to make in the circumstances.\nFurther Particulars of Grounds for striking out the\naction\n(i) The plaintiff has failed to join as co-plaintiffs\nthose members of the Nigerian Bar Association who\nstand for the cause espoused by him and who agree\nwith him in controversy to be resolved;\n(ii) The plaintiff has failed to join as Defendants\nthose members of the Nigerian Bar Association who\nstand for the cause espoused by him and who\ndisagreed with him in the way in which they wish\nthe matters in controversy to be resolved;\n(iii) The plaintiff has failed to join as Defendants\nthose members of the Nigerian Bar Association who\noppose the cause espoused by him;\n(iv) In the premises all persons who will or are\nlikely to be affected by the judgment of the court\nare not before the court either in person or by\nrepresentation.\nArguments were taken at the trial court on the two\napplications to it. On 19th July, 1985 the learned\ntrial Judge, C. A. Johnson, C.J., delivered his ruling.\nThe first part of his ruling was concerned with the\napplication of the 1st Defendant to strike him out\nand to strike out the plaintiffs action on the ground\nthat it was incompetent. Having considered the\nvarious arguments made to him in this regard he\nruled as follows on the point whether or not the\n16\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n10/136\nfirst Defendant is a juristic person and capable of\nsuing and being sued:\n\"It is my considered view, having taken account of\nthe implications of the different legislations\nrecognising, imposing duties and granting privilege\nto the Association as a body, that it is meant to\ngive the Association, even though unincorporated,\na legal personality and I so hold. I therefore rule on\nthat issue that the 1st Defendant is a juristic\nperson and properly sued by the applicant as a\nDefendant in this suit.\"\nOn the preliminary objection of Chief F. R. A.\nWilliams to which I have referred earlier on in this\njudgment to the application of the plaintiff to the\ntrial court to restrain the three Senior Advocates\nnamed in the application from appearing for the\nfirst Defendant, the learned trial Chief Judge held\nas follows:\nFirstly \"It has been argued, relying on the provision\nof Section 25 of the Evidence Law that the affidavit\nin support of the applicant's application is\ninadmissible and consequently if this is accepted,\nthere is no application before the Court. What does\nSection 25 provide?\nThe Section reads:\n\"25. In civil cases no admission is relevant, if it is\nmade either upon an express condition that\nevidence of it is not to be given, or in\ncircumstances from which the court can infer that\nthe parties agreed together that evidence of it\nshould not be given; Provided that nothing in this\nsection shall be taken to exempt any legal\n17\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n11/136\npractitioner from giving evidence of any matter of\nwhich he may be compelled to give evidence under\nSection 169.\"\nTo start with there is nothing to show\nthat it was ever agreed as an express condition that\nno evidence of what transpired at the reconciliatory\nmeeting in Sir Adetokunbo Ademola's house should\nnot be given; but can we infer from the\ncircumstances that the parties agreed together that\nsuch evidence should not be given? That second\nleg, being a matter of inference, evidence of such\nagreement need not be in writing or express but\ncould be by conduct. \"\nThe learned Chief Judge having examined the provisions\nof Sec. 25 of the Evidence Act and the circumstances\nunder which the statements contained in the\naffidavit evidence of the plaintiff were made answered\nthe question he posed for himself as to whether from\nthe circumstances in question it can be inferred that\nthe parties agreed together that such evidence\nshould not be given as follows:\n\"That incident as relayed in the affidavit of the\napplicant and uncontroversial, clearly removed\nwhatever inference one could have drawn that the\nparties to the peace meeting by conduct, expected\nall that was said at the meeting to be covered by\nthe privilege of secrecy. On that basis I rule that\nthe provision of Section 25 of the Evidence Law is\ninapplicable to the situation here presented and\nhold that the affidavit of the plaintiff attached to his\napplication is admissible in support of that\napplication.\"\nSo the learned trial Judge ruled that the affidavit\n18\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n12/136\nevidence in support of the plaintiff's application to\nrestrain the three Senior Advocates of Nigeria from\nappearing for the 1st Defendant was admissible. On\nthe motion itself to restrain the three Senior\nAdvocates he ruled as follows:\n\"The said conciliatory meeting was held while\nproceedings were pending in court. Ostensibly to\naid the administration of justice by securing a\nsettlement among the litigants. In that role the\nlearned Senior Advocates of Nigeria and elders in\nthe profession, assumed the mantle of impartial\nconciliators and the duties of an officer in aid of\njustice. The mischief in their subsequent conduct\nlies in the fact that their eventual participation is\nlikely to be construed as reflecting ab initio on the\nquality of their original intentions even if\nmistakenly as likely to taint their mediation. It is in\nthis regard, in my considered view that the learned\nelders breached their duties to the administration\nof justice.\"\nThen he proceeded to make the following order on\nthe application:\n\"On the prevailing facts of the present situation and\nin exercise therefore of the court's inherent\njurisdiction and in spite of the misconceived basis\nupon which the applicant has founded his motion\nthe court is able and thus therefore modify the\norder prayed for an interlocutory injunction to an\norder for an injunction simpliciter. The three\nlearned Senior Advocates of Nigeria, Chief\nWilliams, Mr. Kehinde Sofola and Mr. Molajo are\ntherefore hereby restrained from further appearing\nfor any of the parties in this case as at present\n19\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n13/136\nconstituted.\"\nThe 1st Defendant and each of the three Senior\nAdvocates of Nigeria with which the ruling was\nconcerned were dissatisfied with it and they, all of\nthem, appealed to the Court of Appeal Lagos\nDivision against it. That court coram Nnaemeka-Agu,\nJ.C.A., as he then was, Kutigi, Kolawole, JJ.C.A, in its\njudgment dated 13th March, 1986 unanimously\nallowed the appeal of the 1st Defendant and the\nthree Senior Advocates of Nigeria. It held as regards the\n1st Defendant that it was not a juristic person capable\nof suing and being sued. The 1st Defendant\nwas accordingly struck out of the entire action. The\ncourt held too that the order for injunction made\nagainst the three Senior Advocates of Nigeria, the 2nd,\n3rd and 4th appellants in that appeal was wrong and\nthe said order was discharged. As regards the ruling of\nthe learned trial Chief Judge on the admissibility of\nthe affidavit evidence in support of the\nplaintiffs application to restrain the three Senior\nAdvocates of Nigeria from appearing in the case the\nCourt of Appeal ruled that the affidavit evidence\nwas inadmissible. That court also ruled that the plaintiff\nby reason of his delay in taking objection to\nthe appearance of the three Senior Advocates of\nNigeria had waived his right to raise that objection.\nThe plaintiff is dissatisfied with the whole of the\ndecision at the Court of Appeal and has now\nappealed against it to this Court. All the parties to\nthis appeal have filed briefs of arguments. In the\ncourse of the hearing of this appeal the plaintiff\n20\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n14/136\ntook an objection to the appearance of the 2nd to\nthe 4th Respondents for themselves as parties to\nthe appeal and also for the 1st Respondent. That\nobjection was summarily dismissed at the hearing\nof this appeal. My learned brother, Obaseki, J.S.C,\nhas now given his reasons for the dismissal of the\nobjection. I entirely agree with them and I adopt\nthem as my own.\nI now go on with the consideration of the appeal\nitself. As I have just said briefs of arguments have\nbeen filed on both sides. A joint brief of arguments\nhave been filed on behalf of the 1st to the 4th\nRespondents. It appears that all the parties are\nagreed as to the issues arising for determination in\nthis appeal which the plaintiff/appellant has stated\nas follows:\n\"(1) WHETHER THE NIGERIAN BAR ASSOCIATION\nIS A JURISTIC PERSON CAPABLE OF SUING AND\nOF BEING SUED IN ITS NAME.\n(2) WHETHER THE CHIEF JUDGE WAS\nUNJUSTIFIED IN BARRING CHIEF WILLIAMS,\nS.A.N., MR. MOLAJO, S.A.N. AND MR. SOFOLA,\nS.A.N. FROM APPEARING FOR THE NIGERIAN BAR\nASSOCIATION CONSEQUENT UPON WHAT THEY\nDID AND SAID AT THE MEETING OF THE 3RD OF\nMARCH, 1985 IN THE HOUSE OF SIR ADEMOLA.\n(3) WHETHER THE AFFIDAVIT EVIDENCE SWORN\nTO ON THE 29TH OF APRIL, 1985 BY THE\nAPPELLANT IS INADMISSIBLE.\n(4) WHETHER THE APPELLANT WAIVED HIS RIGHT\nTO OBJECT TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE THREE\nSENIOR ADVOCATES. \"\n21\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n15/136\nI shall take the first issue first that is, whether the\nNigerian Bar Association is a juristic person capable\nof suing and of being sued in its name. The\nsubmissions of the plaintiff on this point run as\nfollows:\n\"THE NIGERIAN BAR ASSOCIATION IS A\nSTATUTORY BODY AND IT IS THEREFORE A BODY\nCORPORATE. EVEN IF IT IS AN UNINCORPORATED\nBODY, WITH SEVERAL STATUTORY AND\nCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES, POWERS\nCONFERRED AND DUTIES IMPOSED ON IT, THE\nNIGERIAN BAR ASSOCIATION is capable of being\nsued as a legal entity in its name otherwise.\nThere is no doubt that the Legal Practitioners Act,\n1975, Section 1 empowers the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation to make its own constitution.\nThe Legal Practitioners Act, 1962, (Repealed) made\nsimilar provision. The Constitution of the Nigerian\nBar Association is therefore a law - a subsidiary\ninstrument - an enactment.\"\nThe essence of the reply of the Respondents to this\nappeal to these submissions of the plaintiff's that\nthe 1st Respondent is not a juristic person capable\nof suing or being sued. It is conceded by them that\nthe 1st Respondent is an entity by itself recognised\nby the law but they maintain that it does not have\nthe capacity to sue or be sued eo nomine.\nI think the point to start in the consideration of the\nmatter raised in this issue is to state the general\nlaw as to who can sue and be sued.

There are of course, several statutes in\nthis country creating corporations, such as\nstatutes creating our Institutions of higher learning\nviz. University of Ibadan Act, 1962, and\nstatutes establishing statutory bodies, e.g.\nLocal Government Law of Oyo State, 1976.\nIt is the submission of the plaintiff that the 1st\nRespondent is a statutory body and is therefore a\nbody corporate. The plaintiff has not directed us to\nany statute to which the 1st Defendant owes its\ncreation. Nor has he directed us to any statute by\n24\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n18/136\nvirtue of which the 1st Respondent has been\nincorporated. For my part I cannot find such a\nstatute. The conclusion I reach therefore is that the\n1st Respondent is not a corporation. The 1st\nRespondent is evidently an association of\nindividuals with its own constitution containing its\naims and objectives.\nI will now continue with my statement of the\ngeneral law as to who can sue and be sued having\ncome to the conclusion that the 1st Respondent is\nnot a natural person or a corporation.\nOn the general law on the point at issue Mocatta,\nJ., in Knight & Searle v. Dove (1964) 2 All E.L.R.\n307 at 309 said:\n\"Counsel for the Defendants formulated a general\nproposition as to when in the English courts an\naction can be brought by or against a party other\nthan a natural person, and gave illustrations of\neach part of the proposition, though he questioned\nthe classification of some of the illustrations. The\nproposition was that no action can be brought by or\nagainst any party other than a natural person or\npersons unless such party has been given by\nstatute, expressly or impliedly, or by the common\nlaw, either (a) a legal persona under the name by\nwhich it sues or is sued or (b) a right to sue or be\nsued by that name. As to (a), namely, legal\npersonae, this may be divided into (i) corporation\nsole; (ii) corporations aggregate, incorporated by\nRoyal Charter or special Act of Parliament or under\nthe Companies Acts; (iii) bodies incorporated by\nforeign law; and (iv) \"quasi-corporations\"\n25\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n19/136\nconstituted by Act of Parliament, such as the War\nDamage Commission: see Inland Revenue\nCommissioners v. Bew Estate Ltd . As to (b),\nnamely, parties which are not legal personae, but\nhave a right to sue or be sued by a particular\nname, these may be subdivided into (i)\npartnerships; see R.S.C. Ord. 81; (ii) trade unions\nand friendly societies, both of which types have a\nmembership; and (iii) foreign institutions\nauthorised by their own law to sue and be sued, but\nnot incorporated: see, for example, Chaff and Hay,\nAcquisition Committee v. Hemhill , a decision of the\nHigh Court of Australia, on appeal from New South\nWales.\"\nIt is clear from what I have said earlier on\nin this judgment that the 1st Respondent is not a\ncreation of statute. Again our attention has not\nbeen drawn by the plaintiff to any statute expressly\nconferring the right to sue or be sued eo nomine on\nthe 1st Respondent. I have rejected above the\nsubmission of the plaintiff that the 1st Respondent\nis a corporation. What remains for me to consider\nnow is the other limb of the submissions of the\nplaintiff namely that having regard to the several\nstatutory and constitutional rights, privilege and\npowers conferred and duties imposed on the 1st\nRespondent, the Nigerian Bar Association, it is\ncapable of being sued as a legal entity in its name.\nWhat I understand the plaintiff is saying in this\nsubmission of his is that having regard to the\nvarious legislations to which he has referred us the\n1st Respondent has been given, impliedly by\nstatute, capacity to sue or be sued eo nomine.\n26\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n20/136\nThe various statutes upon which the plaintiff is\nrelying for this submission that the 1st Respondent\nhas been accorded impliedly by statute the capacity\nto sue and be sued eo nomine are:\n(1) The Legal Practitioners Act, (1975), Sections\n(1), (3), (7), (9), (11), (14), (22), and (23) thereof;\n(2) The Legal Education (Consolidation etc) Act,\n1976, as amended by the Legal Education\n(Consolidation etc.) Act, 1977, Section 2(1)\nthereof;\n(3) Sections 19 and 27 of the Interpretation Act,\n1964; I should say here now that the plaintiff is\nrelying on these two sections of the Interpretation\nAct, 1964,for his submission to us that the\nConstitution of the Nigerian Bar Association, the\n1st Respondent, is a subsidiary instrument or an\nenactment.\n(4) Item 48 of the Exclusive Legislative List of the\nConstitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,\n1979. This provision provides that the National\nAssembly can legislate for such professional\noccupations as can be designated by the National\nAssembly.\n(5) Section 272 of the 1979 Constitution. The\nsection contains provisions relating to the system of\nrevenue allocation between the Federation and the\nStates, among the States, between the States and\nLocal Government Councils, and among the Local\nGovernment Councils in the States. I fail to see the\nrelevance of Section 272 of the Constitution to the\npoint I am now considering. So I shall say no more\n27\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n21/136\nabout it.\nBefore I proceed further I should deal with the\nsubmission of the plaintiff that the Constitution of\nthe Nigerian Bar Association, the 1st Respondent, is\na subsidiary instrument or an enactment having\nregard to the provisions of Section 1 sub-section 1\nof the Legal Practitioners Act, 1975, which says:\n\"1 (1) There shall be a body to be known as the\nGeneral Council of the Bar (hereafter in this Decree\nreferred to as \"the bar council\") which shall be\ncharged with the general management of the\naffairs of the Nigerian Bar Association (subject to\nany limitations for the time being provided by the\nConstitution of the association) and with any\nfunctions conferred on the council by this Decree or\nthat Constitution.\"\nSection 1 of the Legal Practitioners Act, 1975 does\nnot empower the Nigerian Bar Association to make\nits own constitution. It only recognises the\nConstitution of the Nigerian Bar Association. In\nother words, Section 1 says that the management\nwhich the General Council of the Bar can exercise\nover the management of the affairs of the Nigerian\nBar Association shall be subject to any limitations\nimposed by the Constitution of the association in\nthat regard. So the Act recognises Section 6 of the\nConstitution of the Nigerian Bar Association which\nsays as follows:\n\"GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE BAR\nThe powers of the General Council of the Bar over\nthe general management of the affairs of the\nNigerian Bar Association as provided under the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n22/136\n28\nLegal Practitioners Act shall not include:\n(i) Any control over the budget or finances of the\nassociation;\n(ii) The power to appoint representatives of the\nAssociation to any Statutory or other Body;\n(iii) The power to issue public statements\nexpressing or purporting to express the views of\nthe Association upon a matter of public interest, or\nupon a matter affecting the interest of the legal\nprofession generally; or\n(iv) The power to make arrangements (including\nthe drawing up of an Agenda or presenting the\nplace of meeting) for the Annual General\nConference or any other general meeting of the\nAssociation.\n(v) Any decision of the General Council of the Bar\nmade in pursuance of its powers over the general\nmanagement of the affairs of the Association may\nbe revoked or modified by the Annual General\nConference or at any other general meeting of the\nAssociation.\"\nThe plaintiff has not directed us to any other\nstatutory provision pursuant to which it may be\nsaid that the constitution of the 1st Respondent has\nbeen formulated.\nFor my part, I cannot find such a provision.\nIn the circumstances I reject the submission of the\nplaintiff to the effect that the constitution of the 1st\nRespondent is a subsidiary instrument or an\nenactment. This also disposes of the arguments in\nthis regard based as it were on Sections 19 and 27 of\nthe\n29\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n23/136\nInterpretation Act 1964.\nThe plaintiff has on the general law as to who can\nsue and be sued directed us to what Kayode Eso,\nJ.C.A., as he then was, said in the Solicitor General\nof Western Nigeria v. Adedoyin and Ors . (1973) 3\nU. I. L. R. 143 at 149:\n\"What is more important, however, is that the\ncourts have for a long time, and more so in modern\ntimes, promoted a number of institutions to sue\nand be sued in their own names even though such\ninstitutions are unincorporated by any statute. One\nwould easily agree with Lord Denning, M.R., in\nWillis & Anor. v. Association of Universities of the\nBritish Commonwealth, when he said:\n\"We have reached the point foreseen by Professor\nDicey long ago: 'When a body of twenty, or two\nthousand or two hundred thousand men bind\nthemselves together to act in a particular way for\nsome common purpose, they create a body which\nby no fiction of law, but by the very nature of\nthings, differs from the individuals of whom it is\nconstituted, a passage which was acclaimed by\nProfessor Maitland in his Sidgwick Lecture\n(Collected Papers III, p. 306). This fact has now\nbeen recognised by law.\"\nLord Denning in that case was dealing with the\nlegal status of a council.\"\nI do not understand Kayode Eso, J.C.A. as he then was,\nby saying in Solicitor General of Western Region v.\nAdedoyin and Ors (supra) namely: \"What is more\nimportant, however is that the courts have for a long\ntime and more so in modern times, promoted a number\nof\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n24/136\n30\ninstitutions to sue and be sued in their own names\neven though such institutions are unincorporated\nby any statutes\" meant that the courts had done\nthis without paying due regard to the settled\nprinciples of law on the point as to who could sue or\nbe sued as laid down in such cases as Knight &\nSearle v. Dove (supra). In fact, Kayode Eso, J.C.A.,\nas he then was, stated these principles in Solicitor-\nGeneral of Western Region v. Adedoyin .\nThe passage from the decision of Lord Denning,\nM.R. in Willis & Anor. v. Association of the\nUniversities of the British Commonwealth (1964) 2\nAll E.L.R. 39 to which Kayode Eso, J .A., as he then\nwas, referred can only be an authority for the\nproposition that the 1st Respondent, an\nunincorporated body is an entity by itself distinct\nfrom the persons constituting the Association and\nthat the law will recognise such an entity. This is\nwhat Section 18(1) of the Interpretation Act, 1964,\ndoes when it says that \"person\" includes anybody\nor persons corporate or unincorporate.\nWillis v. Association of Universities of British\nCommonwealth was concerned with an application\nfor a new lease under the Landlord and Tenant Act,\n1954, of England. The status of a body, Universities\nCentral Council on Admissions, created by a\ncommittee of Vice Chancellors in England in 1961\nwas then being considered. It was in respect of this\nbody that Lord Denning, M.R., made the statement\nquoted by Kayode Eso, J.C.A., as he then was.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n25/136\nThe context in which the statement of Lord\nDenning, M.R., occurred was as follows:\n31\n\"What then, is the legal status of the council? It is\nnot, of course, a body corporate. But may it not be\na body unincorporated? The Landlord and Tenant\nAct, 1954, like the Interpretation Act, 1889,\nrecognises that a body unincorporated may have a\njuridical personality. We have reached the point\nforeseen by Professor DICEY long ago:\n\"When a body of twenty, or two thousand, or two\nhundred thousand men bind themselves together to\nact in a particular way for some common purpose,\nthey create a body which by no fiction of law, but\nby the very nature of things, differs from the\nindividuals of whom it is constituted\" A passage\nwhich was acclaimed by Professor MAITLAND in his\nSIDGLECTURE (Collected Papers III, p. 306). This\nfact has now been recognised by the law. A trade\nunion (which is a body unincorporated) is a\nseparate entity; see Bonsor v. Musicians' Union (1).\nI think that it would be right to recognise that this\ncouncil is a separate entity. Accepting that the\ncouncil is a separate entity, it seems to me that\neach of these bodies, the council and the landlords,\ncarries on an activity at No. 29, Tavistock Square.\nThe council carries on there the activity of a central\norganisation for admissions. The landlords carry on\nthere the activity of providing accommodation,\nequipment and staff for all the detailed\nadministration of the scheme. This activity of the\nlandlords is, I think, an \"activity\" within S. 23(2) of\nthe Act of 1954. Each of them, the council and the\nlandlords, occupies the lower floors of No. 29,\nTavistock Square for the purpose of its activity.\n32\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n26/136\nEach of them wishes to occupy the top floor for its\npurpose. It is, I think, quite possible for two bodies\nto share accommodation in this way. As I said in\nHills (Patents) Ltd. v. University College Hospital\nBoard of Governors (2):\n\"Possession in law is, of course, single and\nexclusive; but occupation may be shared with\nothers or had on behalf of others.\"\nI think that the landlords can truly say that they\nintend to \"occupy\" the top floor, for they intend to\noccupy it by staff employed by them; and they can\ntruly say that it is for the purposes of \"a business to\nbe carried on by them therein\", for it is to be\ncarried on for their activity of providing the detailed\nadministration of the scheme for admissions. Thus\nfar the Landlords have the requisite intention to\nsatisfy S. 30(1)(g) of the Landlord and Tenant Act,\n1954.\"\nThe case was definitely not concerned with the\ncapacity of the body in question to sue or be sued\neo nomine. It was concerned with whether or not it\ncan be regarded as a legal entity for the purposes\nof the application before the Master of the Rolls. On\nthis point too I refer to the judgment of this Court\nin Thomas v. Local Government Service Board\n(1965) 1 All N.L.R. 168 at page 170:\n\"The first ground on which the claim is resisted is\nthat the Board is not a person capable of suing or\nbeing sued, and if this submission succeeds the\naction must fail in limine. In rejecting it, the trial\nJudge relied largely on Section 2 of the\nInterpretation Law, which provides that\" 'person'\n33\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n27/136\nincludes any company or association or body of\npersons corporate or unincorporated\", but we do\nnot consider that \"a Law to make provision for the\nConstruction of Laws and of the Terms and\nProvisions usually adopted therein\" is designed of\nitself to confer the power to sue and be sued on\nevery unincorporated association of persons. It has\nbeen pointed out that this definition reproduces\nthat in Section 19 of the English Interpretation\nAct,1889, which has never been held to have the\neffect suggested and was expressly said in Davey v.\nShawcroft (1948) 1 All E.R. 827, not to make an\nunincorporated body of persons liable to criminal\nproceedings. In our view it is necessary in every\ncase to look at the instrument by or under which\nthe association is established.\"\nWhat can be said in my view having regard to the\ndecision in Willis & Anor. v. University of British\nCommonwealth (supra) is that it is too late in the\nday to say now that the 1st Respondent has no\nexistence at all known to the law apart from its\nmembers. But in my judgment that is not the same\nthing as saying that it is a legal persona which can\nsue and be sued eo nomine by virtue of the fact\nalone that it has an entity or existence known to\nthe law and nothing else.\nFor his part Counsel for the 1st-4th Respondents,\nChief F. R. A. Williams, has, on the point of the\ngeneral law as to who can sue or be sued eo\nnomine drawn our attention to the American case\nof Forest, City MFG, ETAL . v. Garment Workers'\nUnion 233 Missouris Report 1935 a decision of St.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n28/136\n34\nLouis Court of Appeal, opinion filed January 4,\n1938. There it was held as follows:\n\"1. Associations. In the absence of statutory\nauthority, held that it is general rule that a\nvoluntary unincorporated association does not have\nthe legal capacity to sue or be sued in its common\nor associate name, for the reason that such an\nassociation is purely a creature of convention,\norganized and existing under the common law right\nof \"contract only\" and having no legal entity\ndistinct from that of its members.\n2. Corporations - Associations. Authority for\ninvesting a voluntary unincorporated association\nwith the equivalent status of a corporation must be\nconferred by local statutes and not by federal laws\nif the association is to be regarded as a suable\nentity in this State.\n4. Associations - Corporation. A corporation is a\ncreature of the sovereign power which brings it into\nbeing with an entity separate and distinct from the\nindividuals who compose it and endowed with the\nright of continuous succession during the period of\nits existence, while an association exists purely\nunder the common law right of contract on the part\nof its members, has no legal entity distinct from\nthat of its members, and (sic) not enjoy the power\nof perpetual or continuous succession.\"\nThe general principles stated in that case are not in\nmy view different from the general principles of law I\nhave earlier on stated in this judgment.\nIn deciding whether the voluntary association in\nthe case in St. Louis Court of Appeal, U.S.A., could\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n29/136\n35\nsue or be sued in its own name Bennick, C.,\nobserved as follows:\nFirst: \"But as we pointed out above, the fact is that\nnot even the four local statutes pleaded by\nRespondent have the effect of constituting a\nvoluntary unincorporated association a suable\nentity, nor were they obviously ever intended by\nthe Legislature to achieve that purpose. It is\ninconceivable to think that one desiring to learn if a\nparticular association has been constituted a suable\nentity should be put to the task of leafing\nmeticulously through the pages of the statutes and\nsubsequent session acts to see perchance if that\nassociation had somewhere and some time been\naccorded a privilege of any character not accorded\nto individuals or partnerships, and it is equally\ninconceivable to think that the Legislature, if it had\never desired to constitute a voluntary\nunincorporated association a suable entity, would\nhave done so by the strained and indirect method\ncontended for by Respondent, that is, by exempting\nit from the income tax laws, or by giving it the right\nto select a union label and determine where the\nsame should be displayed, or by giving it the right\nto be represented by a member on the State Board\nof Mediation. No one knows better than the\nLegislature how to go about constituting such an\nassociation suable entity if it should ever desire to\ndo so,\"\nSecond: \"Of course we recognize the fact\nthat even in the absence of express statutory\nprovision the status of a suable entity may in\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n30/136\ncertain instances be accorded a voluntary\n36\nunincorporated association by necessary implication\nfrom other legislation which recognizes such\nassociation as a legal entity, at least with respect to\nthe exercise of the particular power conferred upon\nit.\"\nI have stated earlier on in my judgment that\nauthority to sue and be sued eo nomine may be\naccorded a voluntary unincorporated association by\nstatute expressly or impliedly. In the case of\nexpress authority to sue or be sued eo nominee it\ncan only be expected that the legislature if it\ndesired to constitute a particular association a\nsuable entity would have done so by saying so\ndirectly otherwise than by going about it in a\nround-about way. However when the question for\ndetermination is whether in the absence of express\nstatutory provision, a particular unincorporated\nassociation has the status of a suable entity which\ncan necessarily be inferred from a statute or a\nseries of statutes, one must of necessity go through\nthe task of leafing meticulously through the\nstatutes in question in order to decide the point. I\nbelieve this is what Mocatta, J., had in mind when\nhe said in Knight and Searle v. Dove (supra) at\npage 309:\n\"It was further common ground that no statute\nexpressly conferred the right to sue or be sued eo\nnomine on any trustee savings bank or on the bank\nthe fifth-named Defendant. If in this case there be\nsuch a right or obligation, it must, therefore, be\nderived by implication from the relevant statutes.\"\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n31/136\nSo in the case in hand where as I have said there is\n37\nno statute expressly conferring the right to sue or\nbe sued eo nomine on the 1st Respondent the\nquestion that presents itself is whether such a right\nor obligation can be derived by implication from\nstatutes. In that case one cannot, in my judgment,\nin order to decide the point correctly, help but\nexamine all the statutes which have to do with the\n1st Respondent and to which the plaintiff has drawn\nour attention.\nI have earlier on in this judgment made the point\nthat the 1st Respondent is not a creature of\nstatute. Having regard to this, I must now advert to\nthe following submission by counsel for the 1st to\nthe 4th Respondents in their brief of arguments:\n\"The reasons why the learned Chief Judge came to\nthe conclusion that the N.B.A. had legal capacity to\nsue or be sued are, in his own words (at p. 192 line\n20 to 28) as follows:\n\"It is my considered view, having taken account of\nthe implications of the different legislations\nrecognising, imposing duties and granting privileges\nto the Association as a body, that it is meant to\ngive the Association, even though unincorporated,\na legal personality and I so hold. I therefore rule on\nthat issue that the 1st Defendant is a juristic\nperson and properly sued by the applicant as a\nDefendant in this suit.\"\nThus, the learned Chief Judge rested his decision\non what the relevant enactments did in relation to\nthe N.B.A. and not on the fact that any of the said\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n32/136\nstatutes created the N.B.A. It is submitted that\nNNAEMEKA-AGU, J.C.A., was correct in holding that\n38\nthe decision in Thomas v. Local Government\nService Board does not support the conclusion of\nthe learned Chief Judge quoted above. The two\ncases are distinguishable on the ground that whilst\nthe Local Government Service Board is a body\ncreated by statute, the N.B.A. is not such a body.\n3.6 Implying the Right to sue or be sued from\nStatute:\nIn every case in which the courts have held that\nthe right to sue or be sued may be inferred from\nstatute, great care was taken to look very closely at\nthe relevant statutory provisions. See e.g. Taff Vale\nRailway Co. v. Amalgamated Society of Railway\nServants (1901), A.C. 426; Amalgamated Society\nof Carpenters, Cabinet Makers & Joiners v.\nBraithwaite (1922), 2 A.C. 440; National Union of\nGeneral and Municipal Workers v. Gillian (1946)\nK.B. 81; Bonsor v. Musicians' Union (1954) Ch. 479\nand (1956) A.C. 104; Willis v. Association of\nUniversities of the British Commonwealth (1965) 1\nQ.B. 140; Knight and Searle v. Dove (1964) 2 Q.B.\n631; Thomas v. Local Government Service Board\n(1965) 1 All N.L.R. 168; Solicitor General W.\nNigeria v. Adedoyin & Ors . (1973) 3 U. I. L. R. 143.\nIn everyone of the foregoing cases, the body\nunincorporated which was held to possess (by\nimplication) the capacity to sue or be sued was\neither directly established by statute or established\npursuant to some enabling statutory provisions. Not\none of the cases deal with a body like the N.B.A.\nwhich was not established by or pursuant to the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n33/136\nprovisions of any statute. \"\nI can find nothing in all\n39\nthe cases referred to in the above submissions for\nthe1st to the 4th Respondents remotely suggesting\nthat the proposition that a party can be given\nimpliedly by statutes either (a) a legal personal\nunder the name by which he sues or is being sued\nor (b) a right to sue or be sued by that name, will\nonly apply where such a party is a creature of\nstatute. So I reject such a submission. The reasons\nfor my rejection of the submission will be more\napparent when later in this judgment I discuss each\none of the cases referred to in the submission.\nI am of the view that the approach of the learned\nChief Judge to the point at issue is the correct\napproach and as I have said earlier on in this\njudgment that will be my approach to the point too.\nEven in the American case of Forest City MFG. Co.\nET Al . v. Garment Workers' Union (supra) to which\nCounsel for the 1st to 4th Respondents directed us\nand to which I have referred earlier on in this\njudgment, what was said there was that the status\nof a suable entity might in certain instances be\naccorded a voluntary unincorporated association by\nnecessary implication from other legislation which\nrecognises such an association as a legal entity in\nthe absence of express legislation conferring such a\nstatus. The fact that the association spoken of is a\nvoluntary association denotes that it is not a\ncreation of statute.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n34/136\nThe plaintiff in his submission that capacity to sue\nor be sued eo nomine has been conferred impliedly\nby statute on the 1st Respondent relies on the\nfollowing decided cases:\n40\n(a) Thomas v. Local Government Service Board\n(1965) 1 All N.L.R. 168 at 170;\n(b) William Kpebimoh v. The Board of Governors\nWestern Ijaw Teachers Training College (1966) 1\nN. M. L. R. 130;\n(c) The Solicitor-General Western Nigeria v. Adedji\nAdedoyin CA W/83/69 of 30th August, 1971\nreported in The University of Ife Law Report in\n(1973) 3 U.I.L.R. 143;\n(d) Canadian Case of Bass v. Pharmaceutical\nAssociation of British Columbia 51 D.L.A. (2D) p.\n552; and\n(e) Australian Case of Clyne v. The New South\nWales Bar Association (1960) 104 C.L.R. 186.\nI have referred to the cases in which, according to\ncounsel for the 1st to the 4th Respondents the\ncourts had held that the right to sue and be sued\nmay be inferred from statute. I have rejected the\nsubmission of counsel for the 1st to the 4th\nRespondents that the capacity to sue or be sued\ncould only arise by implication when the body in\nquestion is directly established by statute or\nestablished pursuant to some enabling statutory\nprovisions. There is, however, the other leg of the\nsubmission of counsel for the 1st to the 4th\nRespondents to the effect that in every case in\nwhich the courts had held that the right to sue or\nbe sued might be inferred from statutes great care\nwas taken to look very closely at the relevant\nstatutory provisions. I agree to this submission and\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n35/136\nthis is what I intend to do in the case in hand.\nBefore I embark on the examination of the relevant\n41\nstatutes in this case I think I should find out what\nassistance I can get from the various decided cases\ncited to us.\nI do not think that the following two cases to\nwhich the plaintiff referred us to case, namely:\n(i) The Canadian Case of Bass v.\nPharmaceutical Association of British Columbia\n(supra) and\n(ii) The Australian Case of Clyne v. The\nNew South Wales Bar Association (supra)\ncan be relied upon as authorities for coming to a\ndecision in this case that the 1st Respondent has a\ncapacity granted to it by statute implied to sue and\neo nomine. The decision in the former case depended\non the statute relevant to the body in the question\nregistered, they enjoy certain advantages in that\ncase, that is, the Pharmacy Act of British Columbia,\n1969. Obviously we are not concerned with that\nstatute here and the plaintiff has not cited to us any\nlocal stature comparable to that statute. In the\nlatter case, that is, the Australian case, the body in\nquestion was in fact a voluntary incorporated\nassociation. I have held earlier on in this judgment\nthat the 1st Respondent is not an incorporated\nassociation. So that case is not in point here.\nI go now to the Trade Union cases in England\nreferred to by counsel for the 1st to the 4th\nRespondents, starting with the case of Taff Vale\nRailway Co. v. Amalgamated Society of Railway\nServants (supra). In that case it was held that a\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n36/136\nTrade Union registered under the Trade Union Act,\n42\n1871 and 1876 could sue or be sued in its\nregistered name. Lord Macnagthen in his speech in\nthe House of Lords in the case said as follows: At\npage 437\n\"Parliament has legalized trade unions,\nwhether registered or not; if registered, they enjoy\ncertain advantages\"...........................................\nat page 438\n\"The substantial question, therefore, as Farwell, J. put\nit, is this:\nHas the Legislature authorised the creation\nof numerous bodies of men capable of owning great\nwealth and of acting by agents with absolutely no\nresponsibility for the wrongs they may do to other\npersons by the use of that wealth and the\nemployment of those agents? In my opinion,\nParliament has done nothing of the kind. I cannot\nfind anything in the Acts of 1871 and 1876, or\neither of them, from beginning to end, to warrant\nor suggest a notion.\" ..............\nThen, if trade unions are not above the law, the\nonly remaining question, as it seems to me, is one\nof form. How are these bodies to be sued? I have\nno doubt whatever that a trade union, whether\nregistered or unregistered, may be sued in a\nrepresentative action if the persons selected as\nDefendants be persons who, from their position,\nmay be taken fairly to represent the body.\"\nat pages 439-440\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n37/136\n\"May a registered trade union be sued in and by its\nregistered name? For my part, I cannot see any\ndifficulty in the way of such a suit. It is quite true\nthat a registered trade union is not a corporation,\nbut it has a registered name and a registered office.\nThe registered name is nothing more than a\ncollective name for all the members. The registered\n43\noffice is the place where it carries on business. A\npartnership firm which is not a corporation, nor, I\nsuppose, a legal entity, may now be sued in the\nfirm's name. And when I find that the Act of\nParliament actually provides for a registered trade\nunion being sued in certain cases for penalties by\nits registered name, as a trade union, and does not\nsay that the cases specified are the only cases in\nwhich it may be so sued, I can see nothing contrary\nto principle, or contrary to the provisions of the\nTrade Union Acts, in holding that a trade union may\nbe sued by its registered name.\" The other Trade\nUnion cases namely:\nAmalgamated Society of carpenters, Cabinet Makers &\nJoiners v. Braithwaite, National Union of General and\nMuicipal Workers v. Gillian, Bonsor v. Musicians Union\n(all of them supra) followed the decision in Taff Vale\nRailway Co. case and the principles laid down in that\ncase.\nIt should be observed that the Trade Unions in\nquestion were not each of them a creature of\nstatute. Nor were they, none of them, established\npursuant to an Act of Parliament. They were only\nregistered under the relevant Trade Union Act. In\nfact, in Bonsor v. Musicians' Union (supra) it was\nheld per Lord Keith of Avonholm:\n\"The legal characteristics of a registered trade\nunion differentiate it from other voluntary\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n38/136\nassociations and may entitle it to be called a legal\nentity, while at the same time remaining an\nunincorporated association of individuals.\"\nThe case of William Kpebimoh v. The Board of Governors\nWestern Ijaw Teachers Training College (supra) was\n44\nconcerned with a body, i.e. the Board of Governors\nof Western Ijaw Teachers Training College created\nby statute, under Section 3 of the Education Law of\nthe then Western Region of Nigeria, Cap.34, Laws\nof Western Region. The learned trial Judge who\ntook the case in coming to the decision that the\nbody could in the absence of express legislation to\nthat effect sue and be sued eo nomine followed the\ndecision in the Trade Union Cases U. K. which I\nhave discussed above and the decision of this Court\nin Thomas v. Local Government Service Board\n(supra) which again I have touched on earlier on in\nthis judgment. I will say more about the latter case\nlater on in this judgment.\nI have earlier on discussed the principle laid down in\nWillis v. Association of Universities of the British\nCommonwealth (supra). I have also too considered\nthe decision in Solicitor-General Western Nigeria v.\nAdedoyin and Ors. (supra).\nI should now try to extract some principles of\napproach or salient points from these various cases\nthat may be of assistance to me in examining the\nrelevant statutes applicable to the first Respondent\nin this case.\nThe points of major importance in the Taff Vale\nRailway case and the other trade union cases which\nI referred to above are as follows. In Taff Vale\nRailway case, which was applied in the other trade\nunion cases, the House of Lords restored the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n39/136\njudgment of Farwell, J. that an action in tort could\nbe brought against a trade union in its registered\nname. It was there emphasised that the legislature,\n45\nin giving a trade union the capacity to own property\nand the capacity to act by agents had without\nincorporating it given it two of the essential\nqualities of a corporation in respect of liability for\ntort. It was also emphasised that a registered trade\nunion was not a corporation, it being only an\nassociation of individuals, but had to have a\nregistered name and a registered office. The point\nwas also emphasised that the legislature provided\nfor a registered trade union being sued in certain\ncases for penalties by its registered name as a\ntrade union. Willis v. Association of the British\nCommonwealth (supra) was not as I have shown\nconcerned with capacity of unincorporated\nassociation to sue or be sued but was concerned\nwith the juridical personality of such an association.\nSo the decision in that case is not quite in point\nhere.\nIn Knight & Searle v. Dove (supra) the principles\nlaid down in the Taff Vale Railway case were borne\nin mind by Mocatta, J., in examining the facts and\nthe relevant statutes relating to the bank in the\ncase before him to see if by implication from the\nexpress words of the statute it was possible to sue\nthe bank in its own name.\nIn the case of Thomas v. Local Government Service\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n40/136\nBoard (supra), upon which both sides in this appeal\nrely heavily the question was whether a creation of\nstatute could be sued eo nomine. The case of\nKnight & Searle v. Dove (supra) was referred to\nthere and then it was pointed out that that case\nwas not concerned with (1) the position of a body\n46\ncreated by statute for the discharge of public\nfunctions or (2) the possibility of distinguishing\nbetween liability for tort, with which it was\nconcerned, and liability to be sued for a declaration.\nAs regards the latter claim reference was made to\nthe case of Vine v. National Dock Labour Board\n(1957) A.C. 488 where a statutory board had been\nmade a proper Defendant to a declaratory action\neven in the absence of express statutory provision\nfor it to sue or be sued eo nomine.\nIn Thomas v. Local Government Service Board\n(supra) this Court emphasised the point that having\nregard to the functions the Defendant there, the\nLocal Government Service Board, a statutory body,\nhad to perform it was liable to be sued for a\ndeclaration more especially so since the statutory\nprovisions relating to the office of the\nplaintiff/appellant in the case were such that\ninjustice might result if the Board could not be\nmade a Defendant to any kind of proceedings.\nIn the case of Solicitor-General Western Nigeria v.\nAdedoyin (supra) it was emphasised that to\ndetermine the issue of legal persona in that case\nthe relevant statutory and constitutional provisions\nhad to be examined in order to discover the\nstatutory and constitutional functions of a\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n41/136\npermanent secretary and then decide,having regard\nto those functions, whether a Permanent Secretary\ncould sue or be sued in respect of matters arising\nfrom the functions. In effect, the decision in\nThomas v. Local Government Service Board was\napplied in Solicitor-General Western Nigeria v.\n47\nAdedoyin (supra).\nIn William Kpebimoh v. The Board of Governors\nWestern Ijaw Teachers Training College (supra) the\ndecisions in the English trade unions cases and that\nin Thomas v. Local Government Board were\napplied.\nIn the American case of Forest City MFG. Co. ET A l.\nv. Garment Workers' Union (supra) the point was\nmade that it was inconceivable to think that the\nlegislature if it had ever desired to constitute a\nvoluntary unincorporated association a suable\nentity would do so by the strained and indirect\nmethod contended for by the Respondent in the\ncase, that is, by giving it the right to be\nrepresented by a member on the State Board of\nMediation.\nThe decision in Knight & Searle v. Dove (supra)\nshows that the implication that an unincorporated\nbody has been given by statute capacity to sue and\nbe sued must arise from the express words of the\nstatute.\nI have mentioned the statutory provisions upon\nwhich the plaintiff relies. As regards Section 1(1) of\nthe Legal Practitioners Act, the plaintiff submits as\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n42/136\nfollows:\n\"There is no doubt that the Legal Practitioners Act,\n1975, Section 1 empowers the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation to make its own Constitution. The Legal\nPractitioners Act, 1962, (repealed) made similar\nprovision.\nThe Constitution of the Nigerian Bar Association is\ntherefore a law - a subsidiary Instrument - and\n48\nenactment.\"\nSection 1(1) of the Legal Practitioners Act does not\nas I have said earlier on in this judgment give the\n1st Respondent Association the power to make\nits Constitution. Exh. F, the Constitution of the\nAssociation, was not made pursuant to a\nstatutory instrument or an enactment. It is a\nprivate document. However the Act recognises\nits existence by making the general management\nwhich the General Council of the Bar is to exercise over\nthe affairs of the 1st Respondent subject to any\nlimitations for the time being provided for by\nthe Constitution. Besides doing this the Act does not\ngive any statutory status to the Constitution. I do not\nsee how in the circumstance I can by examining\nthe provisions of Exh. F say the legislature has\nby implication given the capacity to sue or be sued\neo nomine to the 1st Respondent.\nIt is clear from the provisions of all the statutes\nrelied upon by the plaintiff that it can be said that\nthe legislature has recognised the 1st Respondent\nas a legal entity distinct from its individual\nmembers. In fact the provisions of Section 18 of\nthe Interpretation Act, 1964, which define \"Person\"\nas including any body or persons corporate or\nincorporate have the same effect. The decision in\nWillis and Anor. v. Association of Universities of the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n43/136\nBritish Commonwealth points in the same direction.\nSo as I have already said it may be too late in the\nday to say now that the 1st Respondent has no\nexistence at all recognised by law apart from that\nof its members. That the recognition of the legal\nexistence of the 1st Respondent by statute or by\n49\nlaw will not per se be construed as giving it the\ncapacity to sue or be sued eo nomine is evident\nfrom the passage from the judgment of this court in\nThomas v. Local Government Service Board (supra)\nto which I have earlier on in this judgment\nreferred.\nThe following passage from the judgment of\nMocatta, J., in Knight & Searle v. Dove (supra) at\npage 315 suggests the same thing as regards even\na body created by statute:\n\"The question which I have to decide, however, is\nwhether as the result of the relevant statutes and\nthe action taken pursuant to them in the setting-up\nof the bank, something has been created which is\nsufficiently recognizable in law to be suable in tort.\nI have not to decide whether a body or aggregate\nof natural persons has been incorporated.\"\nSo, apart from the recognition or creation of an\nunincorporated body as a legal entity by statute\none has to look further into the relevant statutes in\norder to determine whether or not it has been\ngiven impliedly by legislature the capacity to sue or\nbe sued eo nomine. And as was pointed in the\nAmerican case of Forest City MFG. Co. ET A l. v.\nGarment Workers' Union (supra) the fact that\nlegislature gave an unincorporated association the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n44/136\nright to be represented by a member on a statutory\nboard is no indication that legislature constituted\nsuch an association a suable entity. I will follow\nthat decision. This means that I am not prepared to\nhold from the rights given by various statutory\nprovisions to the 1st Respondent to appoint,\n50\nnominate or elect some of its members to serve as\nmembers of various statutory bodies legislature has\nimpliedly given the capacity to sue and be sued to\nthe 1st Respondent. Such rights were conferred on\nthe 1st Respondent by Sections 1(2) & (3), 3, 9(2),\n11(2), 14(1)(a)-(c) of the Legal Practitioners Act,\n1975 and Section 2(1) of the Legal Education\n(Consolidation etc.) Act, 1976 , as subsequently\namended.\nI now turn to Section 7 and Section 22 of the Legal\nPractitioners Act, 1975. The former by its\nsub-section 4(c) provides that the Chief Registrar of\nthe Supreme Court shall pay yearly to the 1st\nRespondent a sum equal to nine tenths of the\naggregate of the practising fees received by him.\nThe latter provides for the duties of the Association\nas regards the money paid to it by the registrar. In\na way, the statute provides for the association to\nown personalty i.e. money albeit on trust.\nAs regards the duties imposed on the 1st\nRespondent in relation to the money given it, the\nstatute says nothing about sanction for breach of\nany of the duties, let alone the procedure for the\nenforcement of the sanction. So there is nothing in\nthis case like the statutory provisions in Taff Vale\nRailway case for a registered trade union being\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n45/136\nsued in certain cases for penalties in its registered\nname.\nThe implication of the statutory provisions in\nSection 7 of the Act in question is that the 1st\nRespondent can own money, personally. There is\nnothing however, there to suggest that the\n51\nDefendant can own land. This necessarily takes me\nto the provisions of Section 13 of the Constitution of\nthe 1st Respondent which as I said above, has, so\nto say, received statutory recognition:\n\"The National Executive Committee is empowered\nto appoint Trustees and Committees to raise money\nand develop the property of the Association in the\nbest interest of the Association.\nThe Trustees shall hold office for life or until\nresignation unless removed from office by a\nresolution of the National Executive Committee.\n(a) The number of Trustees shall not be more than\nfive or less than three, and all properties of the\nAssociation freehold or leasehold, and other\ninterests in land acquired for the use and benefit of\nthe Association shall be vested in them.\n(b) The Trustees shall deal with the properties of\nthe Association as directed in writing by the\nExecutive Committee.\n(c) The Trustees may apply for registration under\nthe Land Perpetual Succession Act, Cap.98 of the\nLaws of Nigeria.\"\nUpon the registration of the Trustees designated in\nSection 13 of the Constitution of the 1st\nRespondent, Section 2(3) of the Land (Perpetual\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n46/136\nSuccession) Act, Cap.98, Laws of the Federation of\nNigeria provides:\n\"The trustees or trustee shall thereupon become a\nbody corporate by the name described in the\ncertificate, and shall have perpetual succession and\na common seal, and power to sue and be sued in\nsuch corporate name, and subject to the conditions\n52\nand directions contained in the said certificate to\nhold and acquire, and by instruments under such\nseal to convey, assign and demise, any land or any\ninterest therein now or hereafter belonging to, or\nheld for the benefit of, such community, body or\nassociation of persons, in such and the like manner,\nand subject to such restrictions and provisions, as\nsuch trustees or trustee might, without such\nincorporation,hold or acquire, conveyor assign, or\ndemise the same for the purposes of such\ncommunity, body or association of persons.\"\nSo, in Section 13 of its Constitution, the association\nrecognises it that it cannot own land.\nIn all the relevant statutes before us there are no\nexpress words that the 1st Respondent can own\nproperty. It is only by implication that I have come\nto the conclusion above that having regard to the\nprovisions of Section 7(4)(c) of the Legal\nPractitioners Act, 1975 the 1st Respondent can\nown money personalty. That however is in my\njudgment a far cry from saying that there is a\nstatutory provision that the 1st Respondent can\nown property generally which is not the case as I\nhave just shown.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n47/136\nThere are equally no provisions in any of the\nstatutes upon which the plaintiff is relying saying\nthat the 1st Respondent can act by agent.\nThere is also no legislation providing for the\nregistration of the 1st Respondent or that it must\nhave a registered name. In fact the 1st Respondent\nis not an association registered pursuant to any\nlegislation.\n53\nBecause of what I have said above, I am satisfied\nthat the principles laid down in Taff Vale Railway\ncase and the other U.K. Trade Union cases will not\napply to the 1st Respondent for one to hold on the\nstrength of those cases that the legislature has\nimpliedly given the capacity to sue and be sued eo\nnomine to it.\nI now have to see whether having regard to the\ndecision in Thomas v. Local Government Service\nBoard (supra) I can hold that the 1st Respondent\nhas the capacity to sue or be sued eo nomine. It\nwill be recalled that in holding that the Local\nGovernment Service Board the Defendant in the\ncase could be sued this Court emphasised the\nfunctions that the Board was to perform under the\nstatute creating it, one of those functions being the\nappointment of members of customary courts\nestablished under the Customary Court's Law. The\nother point emphasised in the judgment was the\nlikelihood of miscarriage of justice, if it were\notherwise, to the plaintiff in the case having regard\nto the statutory provisions relating to the office of\nthe president of a Grade A Customary Court he was\nholding.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n48/136\nApart from the duties imposed upon the 1st\nRespondent by Section 22 of the Legal Practitioners\nAct, 1975, as regards the money given to it under\nSection 7(4)(c) of the same Act, I cannot see where\nagain in any of the statutes relied upon by the\nplaintiff/appellant the legislature gives any function\nto the 1st Respondent like those of the statutory\npowers possessed by the statutory body in Thomas\n54\nv. Local Government Service Board. In short, the\n1st Respondent is not given by statute the\nfunctions or powers of appointing the servants or\nemployees of any statutory body or for that matter\nthe statutory power to appoint any servants or\nemployees at all. It is equally evident from the\nvarious statutes before us on the point at issue that\nthe 1st Respondent is not given by statute the\npower of disciplinary action over any legal\npractitioner including the plaintiff/appellant.\nI do not think that the right given to the 1st\nRespondent by statute to appoint some of its\nmembers to serve as members of some statutory\nbodies is on a par with the functions of the\nstatutory body in the case of Thomas v. Local\nGovernment Service Board , which functions\nimpelled this Court to hold that the Defendant\nthere, an unincorporated body, was liable to be\nsued eo nomine for a declaration.\nSo guided by Thomas v. Local Government Service\nBoard (supra) I cannot even reach the conclusion\nthat the 1st Respondent can sue or be sued eo\nnomine having regard to the relevant statutes in\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n49/136\nthis case.\nIt is even inconceivable to deduce from what I have\njust held that injustice might be occasioned the\nplaintiff as regards his grievances against the 1st\nRespondent. For, as Lord Macnaghten pointed out in\nTaff Vale Railway case, an unincorporated association\ncan always be sued in a representative action. In this\nregard Order 13 rule 14 of the Lagos State High\n55\nCourt (Civil Procedure) Rules provides thus:\n\"Where there are numerous persons having the\nsame interest in one cause or matter, one or more\nof such persons may with the leave of the Court or\na Judge sue or be sued, or may be authorised by\nthe Court or a Judge in Chambers to defend any\nsuch cause or matter, on behalf or for the benefit of\nall persons so interested.\"\nThe 1st Respondent is not a trade union or for\nthat matter a registered trade union. The 1st\nRespondent is not an association of persons\ncarrying on business in partnership in the name of\na firm for the provisions of Order 13 rule 35 of the\nHigh Court of Lagos (Civil Procedure) Rules to\napply. The rule says:\n\"Any two or more persons claiming or being liable\nas co-partners and carrying on business within the\njurisdiction may sue or be sued in the name of the\nrespective firms, if any, of which such persons were\nco-partners at the time of the accruing of the cause\nof action; and any party to an action may in such\ncase apply by summons to a Judge in Chambers for\na statement of the names and addresses of the\npersons who were, at the time of the accruing of\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n50/136\nthe cause of action, co-partners in any such firm to\nbe furnished in such manner, and verified on oath\nor otherwise as the Judge may direct.\"\nBefore I proceed further, I have to refer to the\nfollowing passage from the lead judgment of\nNnaemeka-Agu, J.C.A. (as he then was) in the\nlower court in this case:\n\"It is apposite in this respect to refer to what the\n56\nMissouri Court of Appeal had to say in\ncircumstances not dissimilar in the case of Forest\nCity Manufacturing Co. & Ors. v. International\nLadies' Garment Workers' Union 233 M.O. App. 935\nwhere they said:\n\"It is inconceivable to think that one desiring to\nlearn if a particular association has been\nconstituted a suable entity should be put to the\ntask of leafing meticulously through the pages of\nthe statutes and subsequent session acts to see\nperchance if that association had somewhere and\nsome time been accorded a privilege of any\ncharacter not accorded to individuals or\npartnerships, and it is equally inconceivable to\nthink that the Legislature, if it had ever desired to\nconstitute a voluntary unincorporated association a\nsuable entity, would have done so by the strained\nand indirect method contended for by Respondent,\nthat is, by exempting it from the income tax laws,\nor by giving it the right to select a union label and\ndetermine where the same should be displayed, or\nby giving it the right to be represented by a\nmember of the State Board of Mediation.\nI entirely agree with this opinion and will apply it in\nthis case. It is true that all the numerous cases cited by\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n51/136\ncounsel on both sides support the principle that for\nan unincorporated body to have the right to sue\nand be sued in its own name, it must have been\ncreated by or under a statute. \"\nIt is clear from what I have said in this judgment that\nmy approach to the point at issue is at variance with\nthe approach of the lower court to it as can be\ngathered from the\n57\nlead judgment of that court. I have said earlier in\nthis judgment that in the context of the expression,\nrelevant statutes in a case of this nature, one is not\nconfined to enactments establishing these bodies\nsuing or being sued but one has to take into\nconsideration all the enactment relating to the body\nsuing or being sued. This again is at variance with the\nview of the Court of Appeal on the same point\nas expressed by Nnaemeka-Agu, J.C.A. (as he then was)\nin his lead judgment thus:\nFirst:\n\"From the authorities cited it appears to me that\nbodies which can be vested with the status of\njuristic personality fall into two categories. The\nsecond group which, as shown by this case, is the\nmore difficult one, is made up of bodies which are\nnot corporate bodies - companies or corporations\nand are not expressly empowered to sue and be\nsued but are created by statute for the discharge of\nparticular functions which functions are regulated\nby statute.\" (Italics mine)\nHowever, having approached the matter in the\ncorrect manner, in my view, the conclusion I reach\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n52/136\nhaving regard to all I have hitherto said, is that the\n1st Respondent cannot be sued eo nomine in this\ncase. So for different reasons I agree that the Court\nof Appeal, the lower court, was correct in its\ndecision on the point at issue.\nI shall now take the second issue for determination,\ni.e., whether the learned trial Chief Judge was\nunjustified in barring Chief Williams, S.A.N., Mr.\n58\nMolajo, S.A.N.and Mr. Sofola, S.A.N., from\nappearing for the 1st Respondent, the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation. The plaintiff sought to restrain them\nfrom appearing for the 1st Respondent association\non the ground that their appearance for the\nassociation was improper, unprofessional,\ndishonourable and dishonest.\nThe learned trial Chief Judge has expressed\nsuccinctly in the following passage from his\njudgment the facts upon which the application to\nrestrain the three Senior Advocates of Nigeria was\nbased:\n\"The three gentlemen sought to be restrained from\nrepresenting the 1st Defendant are quoted as\nhaving expressed views condemning the action of\nthe 1st Defendant passing the \"boycott resolution\"\nand opening a role of dishonor in which the\napplicant's name was recorded. These facts are not\ndisputed. In fact I wish to say that to the full credit\nand honour of the three gentlemen that, in this\nCourt, they still maintained that they do not\nsupport the steps taken by the 1st Defendant, but\nadded that they differed in the course they would\nhave pursued or recommended in solving the issue\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n53/136\nas against that taken by the plaintiff.\nThey would have preferred a domestic settlement\nrather than an action in court.\"\nI need only add that the views credited to the\nthree gentlemen were expressed at a meeting arranged\nby Rt. Hon. Sir Adetokunbo Ademola at his house\nat Victoria Island, Lagos, among the representatives of the\nNigerian Bar Association, the Senior Elders at the\n59\nBar and the plaintiff for 3rd March, 1985 with a\nview to effecting a reconciliation between the\nplaintiff and the Nigerian Bar Association. The\nplaintiff attended the meeting. So did the three\ngentlemen sought to be restrained from appearing\nfor the 1st Respondent association which was also\nrepresented at the meeting.\nIt is clear that the plaintiff alleged professional\nmisconduct against the three Senior Advocates of\nNigeria by their appearances for the 1st\nRespondent in the circumstances I have stated\nabove. And it appears from the passages from the\njudgment of the trial court which I have earlier on\nreproduced in this judgment that the court held\nthat professional misconduct was established\nagainst the three gentlemen by appearing for the\n1st Respondent and accordingly restrained them\nfrom continuing to appear for it.\nIn rejection, the finding as to professional\nmisconduct on the part of the three learned\ngentlemen Nnaemeka-Agu, J.C.A. (as he then was)\nsaid in the lead judgment of the Court of Appeal:\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n54/136\n\"From all these it appears to me that a conduct will\namount to professional misconduct if it contravenes\nthe provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct\nin the Legal Profession or is otherwise disgraceful\nor dishonorable. I agree with the opinion of Dean,\nJ., in the Australian Case of Re: a Solicitor (1960)\nV.R. 617, at p. 620:\n\". . . A solicitor will not be struck off the role for\nprofessional misconduct, apart from the statutory\nprovisions, unless he has been personally\n60\nimplicated so that he can be said to have been\nguilty of conduct which other solicitors in good\nrepute would regard as disgraceful or\ndishonourable.\"\nChief Fawehinmi has strenuously\nurged on us that the role played by the three\nSenior Advocates is against the spirit of the Rules\nof Professional Conduct in the Legal Profession. But\nI am unable to find anything in these Rules that\nexpressly prohibits a lawyer who appeared at the\nsettlement of a case from appearing subsequently\nas counsel for one of the parties. On the contrary,\nSection 24 of the High Court Law of Lagos State\nprovides:\n\"In any action in the High Court, the Court may\npromote reconciliation among the parties thereto\nand encourage and facilitate the amicable\nsettlement thereof.\" There is nothing in this\nprovision to prevent counsel for parties from\nparticipating in such settlements. And by Order 13\nRule 3 of the High, Court of Lagos (Civil Procedure)\nRules, 1972, any act which may be done by a party\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n55/136\nmay be lawfully done by his solicitor. So, solicitors\nbriefed by parties may, and do, take part in such a\nsettlement and if the settlement fails, parties and\ntheir counsel return to court and continue the\nhearing. If counsel briefed by parties could\nparticipate in both the settlement and the\nsubsequently hearing, a fortiori it appears to me\nthat a lawyer who, as in this case, appeared just as\na participant, - and not as counsel to either party\ncould thereafter appear as counsel in the case.\"\nSo the Court of Appeal discharged the injunction\n61\nrestraining the three gentlemen from appearing in\nthis case.\nThe argument of the plaintiff that the\ntrial Judge was right in restraining the three Senior\nAdvocates of Nigeria from appearing for the 1st\nRespondent in the circumstances I have narrated\nabove is predicated on the submission that their\nconduct offends against the Rules of Professional\nConduct in the Legal Profession made by the\nGeneral Council of the Bar pursuant to Section 1 of\nthe Legal Practitioners Act, 1962, and as\nsubsequently amended. There is no doubt, as\nsubmitted by the plaintiff, that the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct are a subsidiary legislation,\nhaving been made by virtue of a provision in a\nstatutory enactment which I indicated above. The\nplaintiff relies on Rules 4, 10, 14, 21 and 24 for his\nsubmission that the conduct of the three Senior\nAdvocates of Nigeria breached the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct, having regard to the\nprevailing circumstances. It behooves me therefore\nin order to show what these rules are all about to\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n56/136\nreproduce them in full. And in order to see the\npoint now at issue in its right perspective, I intend\nto reproduce too rule 22 of the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct:\n\"4. CANDOUR AND FAIRNESS:\n(a) The conduct of the lawyer before the Court and\nwith other lawyers should be characterized by\ncandour and fairness; and the lawyer should in\ncourt inform the presiding Judge of subsisting\ndecided cases even where the decision is against\nhis client. The lawyer is however entitled to\n62\ndistinguish any such case.\n(b) It is not candid or fair for the lawyer knowingly\nto misquote the contents of a paper, the testimony\nof a witness, the language or the argument of\nopposing counsel, or the language of its invalidity,\nto cite as authority a decision that has been\nover-ruled, or a statute that has been repealed; or\nin argument to assert as a fact that which has not\nbeen proved, or in those jurisdictions where a side\nhas the opening and closing arguments, to mislead\nhis opponent by concealing or withholding in his\nopening argument positions upon which his side\nintends to rely.\n(c) It is unprofessional and dishonourable to deal\nother than candidly with the facts in taking the\nstatement of witnesses, in drawing affidavits and\nother documents, and in the presentation of\ncauses.\n(d) A lawyer should not offer evidence which he\nknows the Court should reject, in order to get the\nsame before the jury by argument for its\nadmissibility; nor should he address to the Judge\narguments upon any point not properly calling for\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n57/136\ndetermination by him. A lawyer should not in any\nargument addressed to the court introduce\ninadmissible remarks or statement likely to\ninfluence the jury or bystanders.\n(e) A member of the Bar must not promote a case\nwhich at his own knowledge is false, nor should he\nfile a pleading or other document which, he knows\nto be false in whole or in part, or which is intended\nto delay the trial.\n63\n(f) The matters mentioned in paragraphs (b) to (e)\nabove are unprofessional and unworthy of an\nofficer of the law charged, as is the lawyer, with the\nduty of aiding in the administration of justice.\n10. ADVERSE INFLUENCES AND CONFLICTING\nINTEREST:\n(a) It is the duty of a lawyer at the time of retainer\nto disclose to the client all the circumstances of his\nrelations to the parties, and any interest in or\nconnection with the controversy, which might\ninfluence the client in the selection of counsel.\n(b) It is unprofessional conduct to represent\nconflicting interests, except by express consent of\nall concerned given after a full disclosure of the\nfacts. Within the meaning of this rule, a lawyer\nrepresents conflicting interests when in respect of\none client for whom he presently contends the\ninterests of that client touch or concern confidences\nof another client to whom the lawyer, at the same\ntime, owes a duty of service.\n14. HOW FAR A LAWYER MAY GO IN SUPPORTING\nA CLIENT'S CAUSE:\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n58/136\n(a) Nothing operates more certainly to create or\nfoster popular prejudice against lawyers as a class,\nand to deprive the profession of that full measure\nof public esteem and confidence which belongs to\nthe proper discharge of its duties than does the\nfalse claim, often set up by the unscrupulous in\ndefence of questionable transactions, that it is the\nduty of the lawyer to do whatever may enable him\nto succeed in winning his client's cause.\n(b) A lawyer should not assert in argument his\n64\npersonal belief in the integrity of his client or of his\nwitnesses in the justice of his cause, as distinct\nfrom a fair analysis of the evidence touching those\nmatters.\n(c) The lawyer owes entire devotion to the interest\nof his client, warm zeal in the maintenance and\ndefence of the client's rights, and the exertion of\nhis utmost learning and ability, to the end that\nnothing be taken or be withheld from him, save by\nthe rules of law, legally applied. No fear of judicial\ndisfavor or public unpopularity should restrain him\nfrom the full discharge of his duty. In the judicial\nforum the client is entitled to the benefit of every\nremedy and defence that is authorized by the law\nof the land, and he is also entitled to expect his\nlawyer to assert every such remedy or defence. It\nmust, however, be borne in mind that the great\ntrust of the lawyer is to be performed within and\nnot without the bounds of the law. The office of a\nlawyer does not permit, much less does it demand\nof him for any client, violation of a law or any\nmanner of fraud or chicanery. He must obey his\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n59/136\nown conscience and not that of his client.\n21. UPHOLDING THE HONOUR OF THE\nPROFESSION:\nA lawyer should expose without fear or favour\nbefore the proper tribunals corrupt or dishonest\nconduct in the profession, and should accept\nwithout hesitation employment against a member\nof the Bar who has wronged his client. The counsel\nupon the trial of a cause in which perjury has been\ncommitted, owes it to the profession and to the\n65\npublic to bring the matter to the knowledge of the\nprosecuting authorities. The lawyer should aid in\nguarding the Bar against the admission to the\nprofession of candidates who are unsuitable by\nreason of their moral character or insufficient\nqualification. The lawyer should strive at all times\nnot only to uphold the honour and to maintain the\ndignity of the profession but also to improve the\nlaw and the administration of justice.\n22. JUSTIFIABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE\nLITIGATIONS:\nThe lawyer must decline to conduct a civil cause or\nto make a defence when convinced that it is\nintended merely to harass or to injure the opposite\nparty or to work oppression or wrong. Otherwise it\nis his right, and having accepted a retainer, it then\nbecomes his duty to insist upon the judgment of\nthe Court as to the legal merits of his client's claim.\nHis appearance in Court should be deemed\nequivalent to an assertion on his honour that in his\nopinion his client's case is one proper for judicial\ndetermination.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n60/136\n24. THE LAWYER'S DUTY IN ITS LAST ANALYSIS:\nLawyers are in duty bound to uphold the law; and\nno service or advice ought to be rendered or given\nby them to clients, corporate or individual, of any\ndescription or to any cause whatsoever involving\ndisloyalty to the law or bringing disrespect upon the\nholder of any judicial office or involving corruption\nof holders of any public office. Improper service or\nadvice in such circumstances as aforesaid is\nunethical and merits strong condemnation as\n66\nunprofessional conduct. On the other hand, service\nor advice rendered or given which impresses clients\nwith the fact that the service or advice not only\naccords with the letter of the law but also embraces\nmoral principle cannot be too highly commended.\nHe must also observe and advise his client to\nobserve the statute law, save that until a statute\nhas been construed and interpreted by competent\nadjudication, he is free and is entitled to advise as\nto its validity and as to what he conscientiously\nbelieves to be its meaning and extent. Above all a\nlawyer finds his highest honour in a deserved\nreputation for fidelity to private trust and to public\nduty, as an honest man and as a patriotic and loyal\ncitizen.\n26. CONFIDENCE OF A CLIENT:\n(a) It is the duty of a lawyer to preserve his client's\nconfidences. This duty outlasts the lawyer's\nemployment and it extends as well to his\nemployees; and none of them should accept\nemployment which involves or may involve the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n61/136\ndisclosure or use of these confidences, either for\nthe private advantage of the lawyer or his\nemployees or to the disadvantage of the client,\nwithout the client's knowledge and consent, and\neven though there are other available sources of\nsuch information. A lawyer should not continue\nemployment when he discovers that his obligation\nprevents the performance of his full duty to his\nformer or to his new client. \"\nBefore I examine these rules with a view to finding\nout whether the submissions of the plaintiff based\non them are well\n67\nfounded or not I would like to refer now to\nthe submission of the plaintiff to us on the inherent\njurisdiction of the courts to discipline lawyers for\nany misconduct. Having regard to Section\u00a06(6)(a)\nof\u00a0the\u00a0Constitution\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Federal\u00a0Republic\u00a0of\nNigeria,\u00a01979,\u00a0which\u00a0says:\n\"(6)\u00a0The\u00a0judicial\u00a0powers\u00a0vested\u00a0in\u00a0accordance\u00a0with\nthe\u00a0foregoing\u00a0provisions\u00a0of\u00a0this\u00a0section\n(a)\u00a0shall\u00a0extend,\u00a0notwithstanding\u00a0anything\u00a0to\u00a0the\ncontrary\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0Constitution,\u00a0to\u00a0all\u00a0inherent\u00a0powers\nand\u00a0sanctions\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0court\u00a0of\u00a0law;\"\n\u00a0It\u00a0cannot\u00a0now\u00a0be gainsaid\u00a0that\u00a0courts\u00a0established\u00a0by our\u00a0constitution\u00a0have\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0inherent\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0jurisdiction\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0appropriate\ncircumstances\u00a0to\u00a0exercise\u00a0disciplinary\u00a0action\u00a0over\nlawyers\u00a0for\u00a0misconduct. So I do not consider it\nnecessary for me to consider or even refer to any\nof the cases cited to us by the plaintiff as\nestablishing this principle. My main pre-occupation\nin the point at issue is to find out whether on the\nfacts in this case and the authorities the conduct of\nthe three Senior Advocates of Nigeria in appearing\nfor the 1st Respondent association amounted to\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n62/136\nprofessional misconduct as found by the trial court\nand contended for by the plaintiff or not according\nto the Court of Appeal and the Respondents to this\nappeal. This I will now proceed to do.\nIt should be noted that the trial court in saying that\nthe three Senior Advocates of Nigeria were guilty of\nprofessional misconduct by appearing for the 1st\nRespondent did not say that their conduct offended\nagainst any of the provisions of the Rules of\nProfessional Conduct in the Legal Profession in\n68\nNigeria. However the Court of Appeal said that there\nwas nothing in those rules which expressly or by\nnecessary implication forbade a lawyer who took\npart in a meeting to settle amicably a case out of\ncourt from again appearing later on as counsel in\nthat case when there was no allegation that the\nlawyer was the peace maker or mediator.\nI have set down earlier in this judgment the\nrelevant rules of Professional Conduct in the legal\nprofession to which our attention has been drawn\nby the plaintiff.\nI will consider rule 10 first. On the facts before us\nin this case it cannot be remotely suggested that\nthe conduct of the three gentlemen sought to be\nrestrained from appearing for the 1st Respondent\namounted to representing conflicting interest, by\nappearing for that party in this case. The three\nlearned Senior Advocates of Nigeria, any of them,\ndo not owe a duty of service to the plaintiff. It is\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n63/136\nnot suggested that any of the three gentlemen\nshared or enjoyed the confidences of the plaintiff\non any of the points at issue in this case. Their\npersonal views on the points at issue are one thing,\nsharing or enjoying the confidences of the plaintiff\non the same points is another matter. It is the\nexistence of the latter which will under rule 10\ndebar any of the three gentlemen from appearing\nfor the other side against the plaintiff. Even then a\nduty of service must be owed by them to the\nplaintiff, which is not the case as I have already\nshown.\n69\nSo it cannot be said that the three gentlemen have\nbreached Rule 10 in this case by appearing for the\n1st Respondent.\nI can now go the consideration of the other\nprovisions of the rules of professional misconduct\nwhich I have set down starting with rule 4 which\nprovides for candour and fairness on the part of a\nlawyer as to his conduct before the court and with\nother lawyers. The candour and fairness which is\nexpected of a lawyer is spelt out thus in Rule 4. He\nshould inform the presiding Judge of subsisting\ndecided cases he knows of even where the decision\nis against him; all facts relevant to the court should\nbe accurately and correctly presented by him to\ncourt; inadmissible evidences should not knowingly\nbe presented to the court and he should not\npromote a case which to his own knowledge is\nfalse. Alongside Rule 4, I will consider Rule 14 with\nparticular attention to Rule 14(b). Rule 14\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n64/136\nemphasizes the obligation on a lawyer to refrain\nfrom the prosecution or defence of a false claim.\nHowever, Rule 14(b) makes it clear that a lawyer\nshould insulate himself in the conduct of his client's\ncase from his personal belief (i) in the integrity of\nhis client and his client's witness or (ii) in the\njustice of his client's cause, the lawyer's\npreoccupation being with a fair analysis of the\nevidence touching those matters. It is not\nsuggested in the case before us that the 1st\nRespondent's resistance to the plaintiffs claims\nagainst it is based on falsehood. It appears that the\nfacts leading up to the plaintiff's claims against the\n70\nRespondents are not in dispute. That is why I\nbelieve he has commenced the actions by an\noriginating summons. It is the application of the\nlaw to those facts that the court will then be\nprincipally concerned with.\nBecause of Rule 14(c) the three Senior Advocates\nof Nigeria in question are in duty bound to shed\ntheir personal views when conducting this case. It\nis only when in the conduct of the case they are\npresenting arguments based on their personal\nviews that it may be said they have breached the\nrules of professional conduct. And there is nothing\nto suggest this up to now. Rule 21 enjoins a lawyer\nto expose without fear or favour before the proper\ntribunals corrupt or dishonest conduct in the\nprofession or perjury when to his knowledge that\ncrime has been committed and to strive to improve\nthe law and the administration of justice. It is clear\nthat Rule 21 hardly applies here.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n65/136\nI now turn to Rule 22 which deals with justifiable\nand unjustifiable litigations and with the provisions\nin this regard that a lawyer must decline to conduct\na civil cause or to make a defence when it is\nintended merely to harass or to injure the opposite\nparty or to work oppression or wrong to that party.\nThe three Senior Advocates of Nigeria in question\nare appearing for the defence. And as I have said\nearlier on in this judgment, this case essentially\ninvolves the construction and application of\nConstitutional and statutory provisions having\nregard to virtually undisputed facts. The plaintiff\nhas invited the court to construe the legislations\n71\ninvolved and apply them to these facts. How can it\nbe said that any legal submissions which the three\nSenior Advocates of Nigeria will make in this regard\nwill be intended merely to harass or injure the\nplaintiff or work oppression or wrong against him? I\ndon't think so. The three Senior Advocates of\nNigeria, having regard to their eminence at the bar\ncoupled with the responsibility attached to it cannot\nhelp but maintain candour and fairness in their\nlegal submissions. So I cannot say that Rule 22 has\nup to now been breached by them. Nor do I see the\nimminence of its breach in the circumstances of this\ncase by them.\nRule 24 says a lawyer is in duty bound to uphold\nthe law whilst rule 25 says it is the duty of a lawyer\nto preserve his client's confidences. From what I\nhave said earlier on in this judgment it is apparent\nthat the question of the three Senior Advocates of\nNigeria not upholding the law by appearing for the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n66/136\n1st Respondent is far-fetched. It is equally clear that\nthe plaintiff is not a client of any of the three\nSenior Advocates of Nigeria. Nor is it even alleged in\nthis case that the plaintiff has ever been a client of\nany of the three Senior Advocates of Nigeria. In fact\nthe question of any of the three Senior Advocates\nof Nigeria betraying the confidences of the plaintiff\ndoes not arise here. None of them on the facts before\nus enjoyed such confidences. So in my judgment\nthere is no breach by the Senior Advocates of Nigeria\nof rule 24 or rule 26.\nThe conclusion I reach therefore having related all\n72\nthe relevant rules to the facts of this case is that I\nam at one with the Court of Appeal that the three\nSenior Advocates of Nigeria have not breached any\nof the provisions of the Rules of Professional\nconduct in the legal profession by appearing for the\n1st Respondent in this case.\nThe essence of the decision of this Court in I. B. W.\nA. Ltd. v. lmana Ltd . (1988) 3 N. W. L. R. (Pt.85)\n633 is that if none of the Rules of professional\nconduct in the legal profession is breached by the\nthree gentlemen by appearing for the 1st\nRespondent then each of them cannot be restrained\nfrom appearing for that party.\nThe case also decides it that the rules of\nprofessional conduct in the legal profession in\nEngland will not apply here.\nI need to refer to Section 10(4) of The Legal\nPractitioners Act, 1975, which says:\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n67/136\n\"It shall be the duty of the bar council to prepare,\nand from time to time revise, a statement as to the\nkind of conduct which the council considers to be\ninfamous conduct in a professional respect, and the\nregistrar shall send to each person whose name is\non the roll and whose address is shown in the\nrecords of the Supreme Court relating to legal\npractitioners, by post to that address, a copy of the\nstatement as for the time being revised; but the\nfact that any matters are not mentioned in such a\nstatement shall not preclude the Supreme Court or\nthe disciplinary committee from adjudging a person\nto be guilty of infamous conduct in a professional\nrespect by reference to such matters.\"\n73\nThe provision reserves the right to adjudge a legal\npractitioner guilty of infamous conduct in a\nprofessional respect by reference to matters not\ncontained in the rules of professional misconduct in\nthe legal profession for the Supreme Court or the\nLegal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee. And\neven then as was pointed out in I. B. W. A. Ltd. v.\nImana Ltd. (supra) that cannot be done in a\nproceeding of this nature.\nThe conclusion I reach therefore is that the trial\ncourt was wrong in restraining the three Senior\nAdvocates of Nigeria from appearing for the 1st\nRespondent and that the Court of Appeal was right\nin discharging the injunction.\nThe conclusions I have reached above are sufficient\nto dispose of this appeal. However, submissions on\nthe other issues arising for determination in this\nappeal have been made to us by counsel for both\nsides. At least in deference to the industry which\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n68/136\ncounsel undoubtedly put into the preparation of the\nsubmissions it is only right that I pronounce on\nthem however briefly.\nI now go into the consideration of the point\nwhether the affidavit evidence sworn by the\nplaintiff in support of his application to restrain the\nthree Senior Advocates of Nigeria is inadmissible or\nnot. I need not go into the contents of the affidavit\nin any detail. Suffice it to say that it relates (i) in\npart to the correspondence between the convener\nof the peace meeting of 3rd March, 1985, Rt. Hon.\nSir Adetokunbo Ademola and the plaintiff prior to\nthe meeting wherein the former invited the latter\n74\nto the peace meeting and the latter stated it as a\ncondition for attending it that he be allowed to\nrecord the proceedings at the meeting by means of\na tape recording appliance and (ii) in part to the\nstatements made by the three Senior Advocates of\nNigeria at the peace meeting which were in fact\nrecorded by the plaintiff with the aid of a tape\nrecording appliance. The plaintiff sought to use the\nstatements as admissions binding on the three\nlearned Senior Advocates of Nigeria at the trial\ncourt. The three Senior Advocates of Nigeria\nobjected. Following their objection to the\nadmissibility of the statements the learned Chief\nJudge who presided over the case overruled it. I\nhave stated earlier on in this judgment his reasons\nfor doing this.\nWhen this matter came on appeal before the Court\nof Appeal Lagos Division, the three Senior\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n69/136\nAdvocates of Nigeria in their appeal against the\ndecision of the trial court renewed their objection\nto the affidavit evidence. Nnaemeka Agu, J.C.A. as\nhe then was, in his lead judgment upheld the\nobjection holding as follows:\nFirst: \"I must observe that nothing was said\nexpressly in the reply about the demand for\ntape-recording the proceedings. It looks as if the\nfirst paragraph of part of the letter of the 25th of\nFebruary set out above was designed to explain to\nthe Respondent that due to the limited purpose of\nthe meeting there would be no need to tape-record\nthe proceedings. The Respondent maintains that his\nacceptance was on the implicit understanding that\n75\nhe could tape-record the proceedings. Nothing is\nshown to have passed further between Sir\nAdetokunbo and the Respondent before the\nmeeting assembled on the 3rd of March. What is\nclear, however, is that the appellants are not\nshown to be parties to, or to have been consulted\nbefore, the correspondences, or to have known\nabout the discussion for tape-recording the\nproceedings. In this state of the facts I agree with\nChief Williams that even if there was an agreement\nbetween the authors of the letters that the\nproceedings could be tape-recorded, as against the\nappellants, such an agreement would be res inter\nalias act.\"\nSecond: \"So if the issue in this part of the appeal\nwere whether or not the evidence obtained by\ntape-recording, even unknown to the other party,\nwas admissible, I would easily have decided the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n70/136\npoint in favour of the Respondent, if primary\nevidence thereof was tendered. But the issue raised\nby this appeal goes beyond the questions of\nordinary admissibility of evidence: it is as to\nwhether an admission made by a stranger to the\nproceedings, assuming that was proved, in a\ncorrespondence between him and a party to the\nproceedings could be admitted to bind the other\nparty who was not a party to the admission and\npersons who came into the proceedings subsequent\nto the admission.\nSection 25 deals with agreement by the parties\nand not agreement by strangers. In the\ncircumstance, it appears to me that Section 25 of\n76\nthe Evidence Act is quite irrelevant to the issue, as\nthe appellants were not or had not the opportunity\nof agreeing or not to the tape-recording of the\nproceedings at the meeting. In my view the\ncorrespondences between Sir Adetokunbo Ademola\nand the Respondent cannot bind the appellants.\"\nThe plaintiff is now contending before us that the\ntrial court was right in admitting in evidence the\naffidavit evidence and that the Court of Appeal was\nwrong in rejecting it.\nThe Respondents to this appeal, i.e. the three\nSenior Advocates of Nigeria supported the views of\nthe Court of Appeal.\nOrdinarily admissibility of evidence is governed by\nSection 6 of the Evidence Act which says:\n\"6. Evidence may be given in any suit or\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n71/136\nproceeding of the existence or non-existence of\nevery fact in issue and of such other facts as are\nhereinafter declared to be relevant, and of no\nothers:\nProvided that\n(a) the court may exclude evidence of facts which,\nthough relevant or deemed to be relevant to the\nissue, appears to it to be too remote to be material\nin all the circumstances of the case; and\n(b) this section shall not enable any person to give\nevidence of a fact which he is disentitled to prove\nby any provision of the law for the time being in\nforce.\"\nSo, the plaintiff is correct in his submissions to us\nthat once a piece of evidence is relevant, it is\nadmissible irrespective of how it was obtained. The\n77\nfollowing cases cited namely Sadau v. The State\n(1968) 1 All N.L.R. 124 at 125, Igbinoma v. The\nState 25 C.S. at 15-16, and Torti v. Ukpabi (1984)\n1 S.C.N.L.R. 214 support this proposition.\nThe statements of the three learned Senior\nAdvocates of Nigeria upon which the plaintiff relied\nin his application to restrain them from appearing\nin this case were clearly admissions within the\nmeaning of that word in Sections 19 and 20 of the\nEvidence Act. I do not think it can be seriously\nargued that the three Senior Advocates of Nigeria\nwhom the plaintiff sought to restrain by the\napplication in question from appearing in this case\nare no parties technically speaking to that\napplication. So any relevant admissions made by\nthem will ordinarily be admissible against them in\nthat proceeding.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n72/136\nAll what I have been saying above is subject to the\nproviso to Section\u00a06\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Evidence\u00a0Act\u00a0which\u00a0for\nease\u00a0of\u00a0reference\u00a0I\u00a0reproduce\u00a0again\u00a0here:\n\"Provided\u00a0that\n(a)\u00a0the\u00a0court\u00a0may\u00a0exclude\u00a0evidence\u00a0of\u00a0facts\u00a0which,\nthough\u00a0relevant\u00a0or\u00a0deemed\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0relevant\u00a0to\u00a0the\nissue,\u00a0appears\u00a0to\u00a0it\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0too\u00a0remote\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0material\nin\u00a0all\u00a0the\u00a0circumstances\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0case;\u00a0and\n(b)\u00a0this\u00a0section\u00a0shall\u00a0not\u00a0enable\u00a0any\u00a0person\u00a0to\u00a0give\nevidence\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0fact\u00a0which\u00a0he\u00a0is\u00a0disentitled\u00a0to\u00a0prove\nby\u00a0any\u00a0provision\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0law\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0time\u00a0being\u00a0in\nforce.\u00a0\"\nThis necessarily takes me to Section 25 of the\nEvidence Act upon which the objection to the\nadmissibility was based at the trial court. If the\n78\nprovisions of that section apply to the point I am\nconsidering, then the admissions of the three\nSenior Advocates of Nigeria relied upon by the\nplaintiff which ordinarily would have been\nadmissible evidence would no longer be admissible\nbecause of the proviso to Section 6 of the Evidence\nAct.\nThe question then is this, do the provisions of Sec.\n25 of the Evidence Act apply in the instant case?\nThe provisions of Sec. 25 of the Act have been\nreproduced in a passage from the judgment of the\nlearned trial Chief Judge which I too have already\nreproduced earlier on in this judgment.\nThis section grants privilege from disclosure to\ncourt any admission made upon express condition\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n73/136\nthat evidence of it is not to be given or in\ncircumstances from which the court can infer that\nthe parties agreed together that evidence of it\nshould not be given. There is no question here of\nthe admissions in question being made upon\nexpress condition that evidence of it is not to be\ngiven for there was no such a condition. It remains\ntherefore to see having regard to the circumstances\nsurrounding the making of the admissions whether\nthe court can infer that the parties agreed that that\nevidence of it should not be given.\nHappily\u00a0we\u00a0are\u00a0not\u00a0without\u00a0precedents\u00a0to\u00a0guide\u00a0us\nin\u00a0the\u00a0matter.\u00a0As\u00a0regards\u00a0this\u00a0point Phipson\u00a0on\nEvidence,\u00a012th\u00a0Edition,\u00a0page\u00a0295,\u00a0paragraph\u00a0679,\nsays:\n\"Offers\u00a0of\u00a0compromise\u00a0made\u00a0expressly\u00a0or\u00a0impliedly\n\"without\u00a0prejudice\"\u00a0cannot\u00a0be\u00a0given\u00a0in\u00a0evidence\n79\nagainst\u00a0a\u00a0party\u00a0as\u00a0admissions;\u00a0the\u00a0law,\u00a0on\u00a0grounds\nof\u00a0public\u00a0policy,\u00a0protecting\u00a0negotiations\u00a0bona\u00a0fide\nentered\u00a0into\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0settlement\u00a0of\u00a0disputes.\u00a0The\nrationale\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0doctrine\u00a0is\u00a0a\u00a0complex\u00a0of\u00a0factors.\nThe\u00a0policy\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0law\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0encourage\u00a0settlements;\u00a0it\nis\u00a0thought\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0\"unfair\"\u00a0that\u00a0advantage\u00a0should\u00a0be\ntaken\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0willingness\u00a0of\u00a0one\u00a0party\u00a0to\u00a0negotiate;\nand\u00a0some\u00a0cases\u00a0discover\u00a0an\u00a0express\u00a0or\u00a0implied\ncontract\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0parties\u00a0that\u00a0without\u00a0prejudice\ncommunications\u00a0should\u00a0not\u00a0be\u00a0disclosed.

But because of what I\nhave said about the juridical status of the\nassociation as opposed to its capacity to sue and be\nsued eo nomine I am prepared to hold that the\nassociation as an entity was a party to the dispute\nto be settled at the meeting and the three Senior\nAdvocates of Nigeria were not. However they were\nneither counsel for the plaintiff nor for the\nassociation at the meeting. They were there to aid\nthe convener of the meeting in his attempt to settle\namicably the dispute between the plaintiff and the\nassociation.

In the words of the convener (see letter\ndated 25/2/85 from the convener to the plaintiff):\n\"The object of our meeting is not to deal with\nrecriminations but to bring an end to a situation\nmost unbecoming of the profession which is\ninjurious to good name of every member be he\nright or wrong in this pursuit.\" (italics by the\nconvener)\nSo the object of the meeting was to enable the\nparties to come to a settlement or compromise. The\nconvener of the meeting was a peace maker or\nmediator. I am prepared to hold too that the three\nSenior Advocates of Nigeria who were aiding the\nconvener of the meeting in his bona fide attempt to\nsettle the dispute were to some extent peace\n81\nmakers or mediators. Because of the rationale\nbehind the principle I am now considering, namely\nthe policy of the law to encourage settlement, it\nonly stands to reason that this legal principle of\nprivilege should extend to statements made by\nmediators in the course of their attempt to settle a\ndispute. Otherwise the legal repercussions to them\nof such statements will deter peace makers or mediators\nfrom attempting to settle a dispute out of court.\nSo\u00a0I\u00a0am\u00a0satisfied\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0case\u00a0of\u00a0Scott\u00a0Paper\u00a0Co.\u00a0v.\nDrayton\u00a0Paper\u00a0Works\u00a0(supra)\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0point\u00a0here.\u00a0The\nfact\u00a0\u00a0that\u00a0\u00a0a\u00a0\u00a0party\u00a0\u00a0sought\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0even\u00a0\u00a0obtained\npermission\u00a0to\u00a0make\u00a0accurate\u00a0recordings\u00a0of\u00a0the\nproceedings\u00a0at\u00a0a\u00a0bona\u00a0fide\u00a0meeting\u00a0to\u00a0settle\u00a0a\ndispute\u00a0or\u00a0even\u00a0made\u00a0that\u00a0a\u00a0condition\u00a0of\u00a0his\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n76/136\nattendance\u00a0will\u00a0not\u00a0in\u00a0my\u00a0view\u00a0alter\u00a0the\u00a0legal\nprinciple\u00a0that\u00a0admissions\u00a0at\u00a0such\u00a0a\u00a0meeting\u00a0are\ninadmissible\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\u00a0courts\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\u00a0subsequent\u00a0\u00a0legal\nproceedings\u00a0between\u00a0the\u00a0parties\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0peace\nsettlement.\nFor the above reasons, I am satisfied that the trial\ncourt was wrong in holding that the said admissions\nwere admissible in evidence in this case and that\nthe Court of Appeal was right in holding to the\ncontrary.

The right founded as it were on\nthe rules of professional conduct in the legal\nprofession is in my view one not only for the\nbenefit of a litigant but also for the benefit of the\npublic. The rules relate to a matter of public policy\nwhich has to do with the administration of justice in\nthat lawyers being officers of the court are enjoined not\nto commit professional misconduct. The conclusion I\nreach is that on the authority of Ariori's case the\nright from which the objection of the plaintiff to the\nappearances of the three Senior Advocates of\nNigeria is derived can never be waived by him.

The first\nissue is\n\"Whether the decision of the Court of Appeal that\nthe Nigerian Bar Association is not a juristic person\ncapable of being sued eo nomine is well founded in\n84\nlaw.\n\" The second major issue is \"Whether the\ndecision of the Court of Appeal discharging the\norder of injunction granted by the High Court of\nLagos State (Candido Ademola Johnson, C.J.)\nrestraining Chief F. R. A. Williams, S.A.N., Mr. E. A.\nMolajo, S.A.N. and Mr. Kehinde Sofola, S.A.N., from\ncontinued further representation of the Nigerian\nBar Association and from representing any other\nparty in the suit filed by Chief Gani Fawehinmi\nagainst the Nigerian Bar Association and the\nGeneral Council of the Bar is justified and correct in\nlaw. \"\nThe appellant instituted an action against (1) the\nNigerian Bar Association and (2) the General\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n79/136\nCouncil of the Bar by originating summons\nclaiming;\n(1) A declaration that the decision of the Nigerian\nBar Association taken at its National Executive\nMeeting in Jos in April, 1984 and ratified at an\nemergency general meeting on the 5th May, 1984\nin Lagos that its members must not appear before\nthe Special Military Tribunals established under\nDecree No.3 of 1984 Recovery of Public Property\n(Special Military Tribunals) Decree 1984, is\nunconstitutional, illegal, null and void and of no\neffect whatsoever;\n(2) A declaration that the decision of the Nigerian\nBar Association taken at the meeting of its National\nExecutive Committee held in Lagos on the 2nd and\n3rd November, 1984 on the issue of members (of\nthe Nigerian Bar Association) appearing before the\n85\nSpecial Military Tribunal particularly that decision\non the plaintiff is unconstitutional, illegal, null and\nvoid and of no effect whatsoever.\"\nEfforts were made to effect amicable settlement out\nof court but without success. It is on record and\nalleged by the appellant that Chief F. R. A.\nWilliams, S.A.N., Mr. E. A. Molajo, S.A.N. and\nMr.Kehinde Sofola, S.A.N., participated in the move\nfor settlement out of court after the institution of\nthe action. Subsequently after receiving\ninstructions from the Nigerian Bar Association, the\nthree learned Senior Advocates, Chief F. R. A.\nWilliams, S.A.N., Mr. E. A. Molajo, S.A.N. and Mr.\nKehinde Sofola, S.A.N., appeared in court along\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n80/136\nwith other counsel representing the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation. Following the appearance of the three\nlearned Senior Advocates, the appelant filed a\nmotion for an order of interlocutory injunction\nagainst the three learned counsel restraining them\nfrom continued appearance for the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation. This motion was followed by an\napplication by motion by the three learned Senior\nAdvocates for an order striking out the name of the\nNigerian Bar Association from the suit and striking\nout the action in its entirety on the ground that the\nNigerian Bar Association is not a juristic person and\ncannot be sued in its name. The learned Chief\nJudge of Lagos State, Candido Ademola Johnson,\nC.J., heard arguments on the two motions together\nand gave a considered ruling in which he dismissed\nthe application of the three learned Senior\nAdvocates on behalf of the Nigerian Bar Association\n86\nfor (1) the name of the Nigerian Bar Association\nand (2) the action in its entirety to be struck out.\nHe then proceeded to make an order not of\ninterlocutory injunction but of perpetual injunction\nagainst the three learned Senior Advocates\nrestraining each of them from giving continued\nrepresentation to the Nigerian Bar Association or\ngiving representation to any other party in the suit.\nThe Nigerian Bar Association and the three learned\nSenior Advocates being dissatisfied with the ruling\nappealed successfully to the Court of Appeal. The\nCourt of Appeal set aside and reversed the decision\nof the High Court (Candido Ademola Johnson, C.J.)\nin the two applications. The Court of Appeal then\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n81/136\nstruck out (1) the name of the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation and (2) the action on the ground that\nthe Nigerian Bar Association is not a juristic person\nand cannot be sued eo nomine.\nThe Court of Appeal found nothing to justify the\norder of injunction against the three learned Senior\nAdvocates and accordingly discharged it. It is\nagainst this decision that the appellant has now\nappealed.\nThe briefs filed by the appellant and the three\nlearned Senior Advocates are a tribute to industry\nand excellence. The issues formulated and agreed\non as issues arising for determination in this appeal\nare fourfold. They are:\n\"(1) whether the Nigerian Bar Association is a\n87\njuristic person capable of suing and being sued in\nits name;\n(2) whether the Chief Judge was unjustified in\nbarring Chief F. R. A. Williams, S.A.N., Mr. E. A.\nMolajo, S.A.N. and Mr. Kehinde Sofola, S.A.N., from\nappearing for the Nigerian Bar Association\nconsequent upon what they did and said at the\nmeeting of the 3rd of March, 1985 in the house of\nSir Ademola;\n(3) whether the affidavit evidence sworn to on the\n29th of April, 1985 by the appellant is\ninadmissible;\n(4) whether the Respondent waived his right to\nobject to the appearance of the three Senior\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n82/136\nAdvocates.\"\nThese issues have been dealt with exhaustively by\nmy learned brother, Agbaje, J.S.C, in the judgment\njust delivered by him. His opinions on all the issues\naccord with mine and I adopt them as my own.\nAdditionally, the importance of these issues gives\nme the urge to add these further comments.\nThe Nigerian Bar Association celebrated its\ncentenary anniversary in 1986. Its existence thus\ndates back to 1886. It was not a creation of statute\nand has remained so without adoption by any\nstatute. It has of course received recognition and\nmention in various statutes particularly the Legal\nPractitioners Act, 1975 and the Legal Education\nAct. The Legal Practitioners Act, 1975 placed the\nmanagement of the Nigerian Bar Association under\nthe Nigerian General Council of the Bar (see\n88\nSection 1). However, the Constitution of the\nNigerian Bar Association was made supreme in all\nmatters pertaining to the Nigerian Bar Association.\nAdministration\u00a0of\u00a0justice\u00a0-\u00a0Meaning\u00a0of\u00a0-\u00a0Justice\nadministered\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0courts\u00a0is\u00a0justice\u00a0according\u00a0to\nlaw. When one talks of administration of justice\noutside the court, the strict rules of admissibility of\nevidence are relaxed and extraneous matters which\nwill not meet the strict rules of admissibility under\nthe Evidence Act are admitted and considered. In\nthe strict sense of the phrase known to law, no\nauthority other than the courts or tribunals set up\nto meet the requirements of impartiality and\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n83/136\nindependence provided for by the 1979\nConstitution can administer justice. When therefore\nthe learned Chief Judge of the Lagos High Court\nobserved and commented;\n\"The said conciliatory meeting was held while\nproceedings were in court, ostensibly to aid\nadministration of justice by securing a settlement\namong the litigants. In that role, the learned\nSenior Advocates of Nigeria and elders in the\nprofession assumed the mantle of impartial\nconciliators and the duties of an officer in aid of\njustice.\"\nHe was in error.\nThe justice in conciliation is that of concession to\ncalm the atmosphere and bring peace. It has\nnothing to do with determination of the rights of\nthe parties according to law. The misconception of\nthe role of conciliators in conciliatory meetings in\nthe search of settlement outside the walls of the\n89\ncourt was a fundamental error which brought about\ndisorientation of the learned Chief Judge in the\napproach to the question of injunction before him.\nIt\u00a0\u00a0is\u00a0\u00a0not\u00a0\u00a0the\u00a0\u00a0law\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\u00a0Nigeria\u00a0\u00a0that\u00a0\u00a0any\u00a0\u00a0legal\npractitioner\u00a0who\u00a0participates\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0effort\u00a0to\u00a0settle\u00a0a\ndispute\u00a0already\u00a0in\u00a0court\u00a0out\u00a0of\u00a0court\u00a0is\u00a0disqualified\nand\u00a0incompetent\u00a0to\u00a0appear\u00a0for\u00a0any\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0parties\u00a0in\nthe\u00a0suit.\u00a0He\u00a0is\u00a0not\u00a0an\u00a0arbitrator\u00a0or\u00a0an\u00a0independent\narbiter\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0sense\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0a\u00a0Judge\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0court\nor\u00a0\u00a0other\u00a0\u00a0tribunal\u00a0\u00a0whose\u00a0\u00a0independence\u00a0\u00a0and\nimpartiality\u00a0is\u00a0secured\u00a0and\u00a0maintained\u00a0by\u00a0law.\nCapacity to sue and be sued; who can sue or be\nsued?

R. A. Williams, S.A.N., Mr. E.\nA. Molajo, S.A.N. and Mr. Kehinde Sofola, S.A.N.,\nwere constituted into independent and impartial\narbiters disqualified from giving legal\nrepresentation to any of the parties because they\nparticipated in the unsuccessful move to settle the\ndispute between the parties out of court after the\noriginating summons was filed. They would have\npreferred a domestic settlement rather than an\naction in court.\nWas their appearance improper, unprofessional,\ndishonorable and dishonest? This question arises\n93\nbecause allegations contained therein constituted\nthe main ground for the application for the order of\ninjunction. I will regard the allegation as complaint\nof a breach of professional conduct in the legal\nprofession Beyond the mere allegation, were there\nfacts adduced constituting and proving an infamous\nconduct and a breach of professional conduct?\nThe relevant rules of professional conduct in the\nlegal profession that requires examination in the\nlist of the complaints are Rules 4(a), (b), (c), (d),\n(e) and (f); 10(10) and (b); 14(a), (b) and (c); 21,\n22, 24 and 26.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n88/136\nHaving examined the facts in the light of the above\nrules, I agree with my learned brother. Agbaje,\nJ.S.C, and the Court of Appeal that it has not been\nestablished that any of the three learned Senior\nAdvocates has breached any of the said Rules.\nThe facts containing admissions recorded from the\npeace meeting cannot in law be admitted in the\ncourt proceedings and I agree with my learned\nbrother that the affidavit evidence containing those\nadmissions produced by the appellant is\ninadmissible.\nThe right of the plaintiff/appellant to complain of a\nbreach of Rules of Professional Conduct is a right to\npromote the course of justice and as the promotion\nof the course of justice is an ever present duty on\nall, especially officers of the court as the appellant\nis, that right can not be waived.\nHowever, as the appellant has failed to establish\nany breach, the second issue must be resolved\nagainst him. The appeal therefore fails and is\n94\nhereby dismissed with N500.00 costs to each set of\nrespondents.\nThe decision of the Court of Appeal is hereby\naffirmed.\nADOLPHUS GODWIN KARIBI-WHYTE, J.S.C.: I have\nread the judgment of my learned brother, Agbaje, J.S.C.\nin this appeal. I have been persuaded by the force of the\narguments and the conclusions that flow from them\nand I agree with both. I also will dismiss this\nappeal. I only wish to make some contribution to\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n89/136\nthe subject-matter of this appeal, which though not\nentirely novel, are of the most important\nsignificance and relevance in our jurisprudence.\nThe background to the litigation and the judicial\nhistory of this appeal which have been stated with\nmeticulous care and clarity in my learned brother,\nAgbaje, J.S.C.'s judgment are adopted in their\nentirety. With the exception of the question for\ndetermination concerning the justification for an\norder for injunction, included by the 1st-4th\nRespondents both the Appellant, and the 1st - 4th\nRespondents expressing it fairly differently, agree\nthat the issues for determination are whether\n1. That the N.B.A. is a juristic person capable of\nbeing sued in its name.\n2. The Chief Judge was unjustified in barring the\n2nd-4th Respondent from appearing for the N.B.A.\nconsequent upon what they did and said at the\nmeeting of the 3rd March, 1985 in the house of Sir\nAdemola.\n95\n3. The affidavit evidence sworn to on the 29th of\nApril, 1985 by the Appellant is inadmissible.\n4. The Respondent waived his right to object to the\nappearance of the three Senior Advocates.\nI will therefore adopt the above formulation of the\nquestions for determination in this judgment.\nThis judgment is concerned only with the first\nquestion, the determination of which is crucial to all\nthe declarations sought. For this purpose I shall\nconfine myself to grounds 1 and 2 of the six\ngrounds of appeal filed by the appellant.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n90/136\nThe grounds of appeal together with the particulars\nof error complained of are as follows -\n\"1. The learned Justices of the Court of Appeal\nerred in law in striking out the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation on the ground that it is not a juristic\nperson capable of being sued\nWHEN:\n(1) Having regard to several statutory and\nconstitutional provisions conferring rights and\nimposing duties and functions on the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation, it must be taken as a juristic person or\na legal personality capable of being sued.\n(2) There is nothing in Thomas v. Local\nGovernment Service Board (1965) 1 All N.L.R. 168\nheavily relied upon by the Court of Appeal\nprecluding that court from considering statutory\nprovisions relating to the Nigerian Bar Association\nin determining whether or not it is a juristic person\ncapable of being sued.\nThe Court of Appeal misdirected itself in law in the\nlead judgment by saying:\n96\n\". . . I cannot agree with Chief Fawehinmi that the\nConstitution of the Association is a statutory or\nsubsidiary instrument within the meaning of the\nlaw. . .\"\nParticulars of Misdirection\n(1) Section 1 of the Legal Practitioners Act, 1962\n(replaced by Section 1 of the Legal Practitioners\nAct, 1975) must be taken as empowering the\nNigerian Bar Association to make its own\nConstitution.\n(2) The Constitution so made by the Nigerian Bar\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n91/136\nAssociation ought to be taken as a Subsidiary\nInstrument by virtue of the provisions of the\nInterpretation Act of 1964.\n(3) Consequently the Constitution of the Nigerian\nBar Association is a Subsidiary Instrument i.e. a\nLaw.\nI have copied the particulars of error relied upon by\nthe appellant because of their assumed relevance\nto the grounds of appeal and propositions, of law\ncontended for Chief Gani Fawehinmi for himself,\nand all counsel to the parties in this case, namely,\nChief Gani Fawehinmi for himself, and all counsel to\nthe parties in this case, namely, Chief F. R. A. Williams\nS.A.N., for the 1st-4th Respondents and Kehinde\nSofola, S.A.N., for the 4th Respondent filed briefs\nof argument. Mr. M. Adio, Director, Civil Litigation,\nFederal Ministry of Justice, appeared for the\n5th Respondent. They all adopted their briefs of\nargument and relied on them in their argument before\nus.\nThe issue for determination in grounds 1 & 2 of the\ngrounds of appeal filed in the first issue for\ndetermination agreed by all the parties. This is\n97\nwhether the Nigerian Bar Association is a juristic\nperson capable of being sued in its own name, i.e.\neo nomine? Chief Gani Fawehinmi contended that it\nis. He relied on several decided cases in this\ncountry, in England, Canada and Australia, and the\npractice in the International Court of Justice in\nsupport of the contention. His main thesis is that\nthe recognition accorded by legislation to the\nexistence in fact as an association of persons of the\nNigeria Bar Association per se, and the fact that it\nhas a constitution which governs its affairs, and the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n92/136\nlegal provisions enabling the association to\nnominate its members into bodies established by\nlaw, were sufficient to raise the implication that the\nAssociation is itself not only regarded but is a\ncreature of the law with all the attributes of legal\npersonality by artificial persons created by law.\nThe contrary contention by the Respondents is that\nthe Nigerian Bar Association is an Association of\npersons recognized by law. To that extent, it is a\npersona juridica. It is not an association of persons\ndistinct from the persons who constitute it to make\nit a juristic person; i.e. a legal person subject of\nrights and duties in law. It has no separate\nexistence. It is therefore not a juristic person\ncapable of being sued and to sue eo nomine.\nAll counsel in their arguments relied on the same\ndecided cases, but appellants and Respondents\nadopting different interpretations as to what the\ncases should be understood as having decided. It is\nimportant to point out that there is some measure\nof agreement on the general conclusion that the\n98\nNigerian Bar Association is undeniably an\nunincorporated association. This was the argument\nof Chief Fawehinmi in the alternative. The\ndivergence of views arose where appellant took the\nview that the Nigerian Bar Association should be\ntreated as a legal person because the law having\nrecognized is as an association of persons, imposed\ncertain duties on it.\nThe\u00a0well\u00a0\u00a0settled\u00a0judicial\u00a0\u00a0view\u00a0in\u00a0this\u00a0country\nappears\u00a0to\u00a0\u00a0me\u00a0\u00a0consistent\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\u00a0holding\u00a0that\u00a0\u00a0an\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n93/136\nassociation\u00a0of\u00a0persons\u00a0without\u00a0incorporation\u00a0cannot\nbe\u00a0regarded\u00a0as\u00a0a\u00a0legal\u00a0person\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0purposes\u00a0of\nactions\u00a0in\u00a0court.\u00a0Forty-eight\u00a0years\u00a0ago\u00a0in Amodu\nRufai\u00a0Shitta\u00a0and\u00a0Ors.\u00a0v.\u00a0Momodu\u00a0Ligali\u00a0and\u00a0Ors .\n(1941)\u00a016\u00a0N.L.R.\u00a023,\u00a0twelve\u00a0persons\u00a0regarding\nthemselves\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0writ\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0\"Executive\u00a0of\u00a0the\nCentral\u00a0Mosque\",\u00a0purported\u00a0to\u00a0sue\u00a0in\u00a0that\u00a0capacity.\nIt\u00a0was\u00a0held\u00a0that\u00a0the\u00a0Committee\u00a0was\u00a0nothing\u00a0more\nthan\u00a0a\u00a0collection\u00a0of\u00a0individuals\u00a0and\u00a0had\u00a0no\u00a0capacity\nto\u00a0sue.\u00a0Thus\u00a0the\u00a0\"Executive\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0Central\u00a0Mosque\"\nwas\u00a0held\u00a0not\u00a0to\u00a0be\u00a0a\u00a0juristic\u00a0person .

The proposition that an action is only\nmaintainable by a legal person was clearly brought\nout in the recent decision of this Court in Nurses\nAssociation v. Attorney-General (1981) 11-12 SC.\n1.\nThus the onus is on the party claiming the status of\na juristic person derived from incorporation or not\nto establish it. In this Court, in Apostolic Church,\n99\nIlesha, v. A.G. (Mid West) (1972) 4 SC. 150 it was\nheld that the corporate status of a body is\nestablished by the production of its certificate of\nincorporation.\nChief Gani Fawehinmi in his effort to discharge this\nonus had relied in his submission on the\nConstitution of the Nigerian Bar Association,\nStatutes, and the rights and privileges conferred by\nStatutes and the Constitution of the Federal\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n94/136\nRepublic of Nigeria, 1979 to contend that the\nNigerian Bar Association is a juristic person capable\nof suing and of being sued eo nomine.\nBoth Chief Williams, S.A.N., and Kehinde Sofola,\nS.A.N., have submitted that none of the statutes\nrelied upon by Chief Fawehinmi support his\ncontention. Accordingly, it was submitted the Court\nof Appeal was right in holding that the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation is not recognized in law \"for purposes of\nsuing or being sued in its own name,\" although it is\nrecognized \"as a separate entity for a variety of\npurposes.\" Mr. Adio for the 5th Respondent adopted\ntheir submissions.\nIt is important to discuss the general concept of the\ncreation of legal personality in our law before\nexamining the claim by Chief Fawehinmi that the\nright to sue and be sued had been vested in the\nNigerian Bar Association on implication from the\nvarious statutory provisions he relied upon. Before\nembarking on this analysis it is pertinent to\nobserve that Respondents are not disputing the fact\nthat the N.B.A. is an association of persons\nrecognised in law. The point of difference is\n100\nwhether such recognition amounts to vesting on\nthe Association the legal attributes of incorporation,\ni.e. the right to sue and be sued in its own name.\nIt is convenient to start with the provisions of\nSection 37 of the Constitution 1979 which provides:\n\"Every person shall be entitled to assemble freely\nand associate with other persons, and in particular\nhe may form or belong to any association for the\nprotection of his interests;.......\"\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n95/136\nThus, the right to form any association for the\nprotection of the interests of the members is\nguaranteed under this provision of the Constitution\n1979 and is an entrenched right. However, such\nassociation of persons, though recognised by the\nConstitution does not ipso facto vest in the\nAssociation the attributes of incorporation which\nalone confers legal personality. It is for this reason\nthat the power to incorporate such associations has\nbeen provided under Items 31 and 48 of the\nSchedule 2 Part 1 of the Constitution 1979. Items\n31 and 48 enable the National Assembly, and now\nthe Armed Forces Ruling Council, to make laws with\nrespect to\n\"31. Incorporation, regulation and winding up of\nbodies corporate, other than co-operative societies,\nlocal government councils, and bodies corporate\nestablished directly by any Law enacted by a House\nof Assembly of a State.\n\"48. Professional occupations as may be designated\nby the National Assembly.\"\nThus an association of persons recognised by\nSection 37 is a lawful association simpliciter. It is a\n101\nrecognition of the reality that the group of persons\nwho have formed an association has an existence in\nfact. In strict legal theory, only human beings are\nsubject of rights and duties. And even in the case of\nhuman beings, the law differentiates between\npersons capable of exercising an independent will of\ntheir own and those who due to infancy or other\ndisability are incapable. Thus there are human\nbeings with rights but without correlative duties. A\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n96/136\nnatural person is a legal person not because he is a\nhuman being, but because rights and duties are\ninherent from the status, and are ascribed to him.\nA natural person is the legal subject or substance of\nwhich rights and duties are attributes. This is the\nstatus of every full citizen.\nOur law seems to me to endorse the proposition\nthat no association of any kind could be formed\nwithout being authorised by the State. Groups of\npersons behave as individuals and exercise the\ncollective responsibilities, rights and duties of the\ngroup. In ordinary language, this exercise of\ncollective rights and duties is personified in the\ngroup. Hence we personify the family, the town or\nindeed the clan without the group being recognised\nas a distinct legal entity separate from its\nmembers. The grant of legal personality of the kind\npossessed by full citizens without legal disability is\nonly capable of being donated by the state. In the\ncase of Sutton's Hospital, Coke referred to\ncorporations as, \"invisible, immortal, vesting only\nin the intendment of the law.\" - See 10 Co. Rep.\nRep. 1(a) 32. Again in Dartmouth College v.\n102\nWoodward 4 Wheat 518 at p. 636, Marshall, C.J in\n1819 defined a corporation as \"an artificial being\ninvisible, intangible, and existing, only in\ncontemplation of the law.\" Hence legal or juristic\npersonality is not attained until the law recognises\nover and above the associated individuals, a single\nentity which represents them, but is not identical\nwith them.\nChief Fawehinmi relies on the recognition of the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n97/136\nexistence of the Nigerian Bar Association by the\nprovisions of the Legal Practitioners Act, 1975\nSections 1(1),1(2),3(3)(9), 3(3)(f), 9(2)(c), S. 23\nLegal Education (Consolidation, etc.) Act 1976,\ns.2(1), Legal Education (Consolidation, etc.) Act\n1977, S.2(1); I shall hereafter refer to the National\nBar Association as the Association.\nThese legislations relate to the creation of the body\nknown as the General Council of the Bar, which is\ncharged with the Management of the affairs of the\nNigerian Bar Association, S.1(1), and also provides\nfor members of the \"Association\" to be members of\nthe General Council of the Bar, otherwise known as\nthe Bar Council- S.1(2) to be elected by members of\nthe Association in the manner provided by the\nConstitution of the Association and to hold office as\nprovided by the Constitution of the \"Association.\"\nBy S.3(3)(g), the Association is to nominate its\nmembers to the Body of Benchers. The President of\nthe \"Association\" is made a member of the Body of\nBenchers by S.3(1)(f). Again, the \"Association\" is\nentitled to nominate members to the Legal\nPractitioners Disciplinary Committee - S.9(2)(c). By\n103\ns.2(1) of the Legal Education (Consolidation, etc.)\nAct 1976 as amended by an Act of 1977 of the\nsame name, the \"Association\" is entitled to appoint\nits members to the Legal Education Council, and to\nhave its President as a member.\nIt is important to observe that in none of the\nlegislations referred to is the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation eo nomine named as a member of the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n98/136\nother bodies created by the statutes. The person\nrequired to be members are either a prescribed\nnumber of the members or the President of the\nAssociation. It seems to me clear that the\nlegislature providing for the exercise of the duties\nrecognise the Association as unincorporated, and\naccordingly have expressly provided for the manner\nin which the obligation will be discharged. The\nrecognition by the legislations that the\n\"Association\" has a Constitution which governs its\nrelationship with its members, and of the members\ninter se is not inconsistent with the concept of an\nunincorporated association recognised by the\nConstitution of the country and does not imply a\nrecognition that the Association is thereby entitled\nto enjoy the attributes of incorporation without\nincorporation.\nChief Fawehinmi also relied on the membership of\nthe \"Association\", the fact that the subscription\npayable annually is regulated by the legal\nPractitioners Act, 1975 and that a specific\npercentage of the fees so paid is appropriated for\nthe Association as part of his contention that the\nAssociation is a statutory body, a juristic person\n104\ncapable of suing and being sued.\nI agree with the submissions of counsel to the\nRespondents and have found it fairly difficult to\nunderstand the contention that because the\"\nAssociation\" is recognised as a professional\nassociation of lawyers, that membership of the\nAssociation is automatic on being a legal\npractitioner registered under the Act, and that part\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n99/136\nof the fees paid by legal practitioners is\nappropriated for the use of the Association, it is a\ncreation of statute. The misconception in the\nargument is one of confusing a body which is\nrecognised as a personification of the members as a\nseparate entity in fact, and capable of acting on its\nown behalf through certain persons who constitute\nand are inextricably part of the body, and that of\nrecognition of the \"Association\" as a distinct legal\nentity capable of acting on its own behalf, and\nowning property without recourse to members of\nthe Association. This was the conclusion the Court\nof Appeal drew, and correctly in my opinion when it\nsaid, referring to the statutes relied upon by Chief\nFawehinmi,\n\"All the several statutes which relate to the\nAssociation show that the law recognises the\nAssociation as being in existence.\nChief Fawehinmi was therefore right when he\nsubmitted that in view of those numerous statutes\nwhich have referred to the Association we cannot\nbut come to the conclusion that it exists as a\nseparate entity distinct from its members. But in\nmy judgment, it is misconception to say that\n105\nbecause it is a separate legal entity, it is\nnecessarily a separate legal entity, a juristic person\nwhereby it can sue and be sued eo nomine. To put\nit in another way, it is a separate entity de facto\nbut not a separate, legal entity, de jure, for\npurposes of prosecuting a suit in its own name.\"\nChief Gani Fawehinmi has submitted that the\n\"Association\" by virtue of the Statutes referred to\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n100/136\nespecially Sections 1 (1) of the Legal Practitioners\nAct 1975 which recognised the Constitution of the\nAssociation and Section 23 which corrected the\nname of the Association from the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation to the Nigeria Bar Association suggests\nthat the Association is a creation of the statute.\nIt is difficult to construe, even if one wants to do so\nin bad faith, any of the statutes relied upon as\nhaving created the Nigerian Bar Association. By no\nstretch of the imagination can the words used lead\nto such a construction. This is because Section 1(1)\nof the Legal Practitioners Act 1975 which\nestablished the General Council of the bar and\nprovides that the body shall be charged with the\nManagement of the 'Nigeria' Bar Association, went\non in Section 3 to establish the Body of Benchers\nand to provide in Section 3(2) that\n\"The Body of Benchers shall be a body corporate\nwith perpetual succession and common seal.\"\nSimilarly, Section 5(3) established the Legal\nPractitioners' Privileges Committee of the General\nCouncil of the Bar, and Section 9(1) established the\nlegal Practitioners Disciplinary Committee; and\nSection 11(1) The Appeal Committee of the Body of\n106\nBenchers charged with the duty of hearing appeals\nfrom the Disciplinary Committee. There are other\nCommittees of the General Council of the Bar\nestablished under the Legal Practitioners Act 1975\nand charged with various statutory duties. These\nare creations of the statute and are accordingly\nvested with the attributes of legal persons.\nBy the application of the interpretation rule of\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n101/136\nexpression unions est exclusio alterius, the\nNigerian Bar Association cannot be construed\namong the express creations of the bodies to the\nLegal Practitioners Act, 1975 and is therefore not\none of the creations of the statute as the\nCommittees mentioned above. Any provisions of\nthe statutes referred to or any other legislation\ndoes clearly not support Chief Fawehinmi's\nsubmission that the Nigerian Bar Association is a\nstatutory body created by statute. Chief Fawehinmi\nsubmitted in his brief argument and before us\nstatutes, Legal Practitioners Act and the\nConstitution of the Nigerian Bar Association,\nregulate that membership of the Association. The\nbasis for this submission is because Article 4 of the\nConstitution as the Association provides that \"Every\nperson duly enrolled by virtue of the Legal\nPractitioners Act shall be a member of the\nAssociation.....\" I do not think this article can be\nconstrued as having any statutory effect or to have\nconverted a non-statutory provision of the\nConstitution of the Association, (the Constitution\nnot being the creation of statute) into a statutory\nprovision. Membership of the Association on being a\n107\nlegal practitioner is automatic, but this is merely a\npre-condition of Membership of the Association as\nprovided by Article 4 of the Constitution of the\nAssociation, which is not a statutory provision.\nWhat regulates Membership of the Association is\nthe provision of its constitution and not the\nprovision of the Legal Practitioners Act, 1975. The\nfact that reference is made to Membership of the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n102/136\nAssociation in a legislation did not alter the true\nlegal situation. The recognition accorded the\nAssociation and its Constitution did not give\nstatutory effect to the Constitution of the\nAssociation or make the Association a Statutory\nBody. Our Constitution in Item 48 of the second\nschedule provides that incorporation of professional\nbodies can only be attained through a legislation of\nthe National Assembly. This has not been done in\nthis case.\nIt is relevant to point out and it seems to me that\nthe Association was quite conscious of its status as\nan unincorporated Association, and legal defect as a\nbody hence it took precaution in Article 13 of its\nConstitution to empower its National Executive to\nprovide for the appointment of trustees who shall\ninter alia, deal with the properties of the\nAssociation as directed to apply for Registration\nunder the Land Perpetual Succession Act. Cap.98\nLaws of Nigeria. By Section 2(3) of this Act the\nTrustees when registered \"shall thereupon become\na body corporate by the name described in the\ncertificate and shall have perpetual succession and\na common seal, and power to the conditions and\n108\ndirections contained in the certificate to hold, and\nacquire, and by instruments under such common\nseal to convey, assign and demise, any land or\ninterest therein now or hereafter belonging to, or\nheld for the benefit of such community, body or\nassociation of persons, in such and the like manner,\nand subject to such restrictions, and provisions, as\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n103/136\nsuch trustees or trustee might, without such\nincorporation, hold or acquire, conveyor assign, or\ndemise the same for the purposes of such\ncommunity, body or association of persons.\"\nBy a combined reading of Sections 3 and 8 of this\nlaw, the Trustees will operate in their registered\nname as an incorporated body on behalf of the\nAssociation. Thus the Association having provided\nfor its trustees to be registered for the purposes\nstated above were conscious of its legal status as\nan unincorporated Association.\nIn Williams v. Sanusi (1961) 1 All N.L.R. 334, the\nFederal Supreme Court held that where a body is\nregistered under the Land (Perpetual Succession)\nAct, the trustees can sue or be sued under the\nname provided in the Certificate of incorporation. It\nis properly arguable that such actions will be\nlimited to those matters covered by that law and in\nrespect of which the Trustees have the authority.\nEven if this was conceded, the Association has no\ncapacity eo nomine to bring actions or be sued.\nRegistration was devised to obviate such problem.\nWhere the Nigerian Bar Association has the status\nof a legal person, registration under the Lands\n(Perpetual Succession) Act would have been\n109\nunnecessary.\nIt may be conceded that no particular form of words\nare required for the purpose of creating a\ncorporation, where the intention to incorporate is\nevident from the words used - See Tone River\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n104/136\nConservators v. Ash 10 B & c. 349. I now turn to\nthe decided cases cited and relied upon by Chief\nFawehinmi as authority for his proposition that the\nAssociation is a creation of Statute, which can sue\nand be sued in its own name. There are the cases\nof Thomas v. Local Government Service Board\n(1965) 1 All N .L.R. 168; Kpebimoh v. Board of\nGovernors, Western Ijaw Teachers' Training College\n(1966) 1 N .M.L.R. 130; Solicitor-General, Western\nNigeria v. Adedoyin, CA W/83/69 of 30th August,\n1971; Adedeji v. Police Service Commission (1968)\nN. M. L. R. 102.\nThere are also the decisions founded on the English\nTrade Union Acts 1871 and 1876, and now Trade\nUnions and Labour Relations Act 1974 such as\nBonsor v. Musicians Union (1956) A.C. 104; Vine v.\nNational Dock Labour Board (1957) A.C. 488; Taft\nVale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway\nServants (1901) A.C. 426; Willis v. Association of\nUniversities of the British Commonwealth (1964) 2\nAll E.R. 39. The Canadian case of Bass v.\nPharmaceutical Association of British Columbia\n(1965) 51 D.L.R. (2D.) 552; the Australian case of\nClyne v. The New South Wales Bar Association\n(1960) 104 C.L.R. 186.\nI shall begin with the Australian case of Clyne v.\nNew South Wales Bar Association (supra). The New\n110\nSouth Wales Bar Association, a voluntary\nassociation of barristers incorporated in 1936, with\npowers to exercise supervision over the conduct of\nmembers of the Bar, and to lay down rules and\ndecide questions of professional conduct and\netiquette, sought an order of the full court of New\nSouth Wales that the name of the appellant be\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n105/136\nstruck off the roll of barristers of the State of New\nSouth Wales on the ground that he has been found\nguilty of such grave professional misconduct as\nshown him not to be a fit and proper person to\npractice as a barrister. The issue of its capacity to\nsue did not arise as it was well known to be an\nincorporated body. This case does not therefore\nsupport the appellant. Again, in Bass v.\nPharmaceutical Association of British Columbia\n(supra) the Pharmaceutical Association of British\nColumbia was registered under the Pharmacy Act of\nBritish Columbia, 1960. The Council of the\nAssociation was empowered to make Bye-Laws and\nRegulations. Bass, a member of the Association\nbrought an action challenging the validity of the\nBye-law and seeking a declaration that it was ultra\nvies the Act. The question whether the\nPharmaceutical Association was a legal person\ncapable of suing and being sued did not arise in the\ncircumstance. The Association was established\nunder the Pharmacy Act of British Columbia, 1960.\nAs Kehinde Sofola, S.A.N., pointed out, and is clear\nfrom the report of the case, \"the apparent objects\nof the Pharmacy Act are to establish the Defendant\nAssociation as a body politic and corporate . . . etc.\"\n111\nObviously, therefore the Pharmaceutical\nAssociation of British Columbia was established\nunder the Pharmacy Act of British Columbia and\ntherefore a statutory body.\nThe English cases of Taff Vale Railway v.\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n106/136\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants (Supra);\nBonsor v. Musicians Union (1956) A. C. 104; Vine\nv. National Dock Labour Board (supra) based on the\ninterpretation of the Trade Union Acts are quite\ndifferent. A careful analysis of the Trade Union Acts\n1871 and 1876 discloses no provision enabling\nincorporation of Trade Unions. Indeed Registration\nof Trade Unions in certain statutes including\nCompanies Acts shall be void - S.5. But the Unions\nwhen registered can make purchases or leases in\nthe names of trustees. A Trade Union, which is not\nregistered under the Acts, does not enjoy any of\nthe privileges of registration. By Section 9 a\nregistered Trade Union is entitled to sue and can be\nsued in the names of its trustees or authorised\nofficers. However, the Act of 1871 did not\nincorporate Trade Unions even when registered\nunder the Act with a name. The present Trade\nUnions and Labour Relations Act 1974, does not\ntreat a Trade Union as a Corporate body, but\nenables them in S.2(1)(c) to sue and be sued in\ntheir registered names, and S.3(1)(b) also enables\nunincorporated employers association to sue and be\nsued in its own name in all actions. The decided\ncases concede that Trade Unions are \"when\nregistered, quasi-corporations, resembling much\nmore closely railway companies incorporated by\n112\nstatute than voluntary associations of individuals\nmerely bound together by contract agreement,\nexpress or implied\" - See Atkinson, L.J. in\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants v.\nOsborne (1910) A.C. 87. The provisions of the\nTrade Union Acts clearly and necessarily imply the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n107/136\npower to sue or being sued in the Society's name is\nclearly and necessarily implied by the provisions\nof the Trade Union Acts.\nWillis v. Association of Universities of British\nCommonwealth (supra), though not a trade union\ncase was decided on the principle, that the\nAssociation of Universities of British Commonwealth\nis a limited company and that the Universities\nCentral Council on Admissions was not a separate\nand independent body, except from the financial\nstand point where it is treated separately. It is not\na body corporate. But the Court of Appeal held it\ncould be so treated under S.23(2) of the Landlord\nand Tenant Act 1954. This is on the interpretation\nof \"activity\" within S.23(2). This is not a good\nillustration of the ascription of legal personality\nbecause it is limited to the special purposes of the\nAct.\nIn each of the cases of Thomas v. Local\nGovernment Service Board (supra), Kpebimoh v.\nBoard of Governors Western Ijaw Teachers'\nTraining College (supra); Solicitor General,\nWestern Nigeria v. Adedoyin (supra), the bodies in\nthe first two cases were created by statutes and the\nlast, a constitutional office, where vested were\nstatutory functions. The Local Government Service\nBoard in Thomas v. Local Government Service\nBoard (supra) was created by Section 93 of the\n113\nLocal Government Law. Section 98 conferred on its\nmembers immunity from suits for official conduct,\nand there is no provision expressly enabling it to\nsue or be sued, or to own property. However,\nSection 97 which provides for a claim for privilege\nfor the Records of the Board and Section 98 already\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n108/136\nreferred to imply that the Legislature is making\nthese provisions envisaged that the Board can sue\nand can be sued. The immunity conferred on the\nmembers for official conduct is not an immunity\nwhich the Board eo nomine can claim. The\nconsiderations taken into account why the\nLegislature implied legal personality in the Board\nwere the nature of the statutory functions relating\nto the office of the Board which might result in\ninjustice unless it could be made a Defendant in\nany proceedings challenging the exercise of such\nduties. The Supreme Court however pointed out\nthat the Customary Laws by implication from\nSection 5 of the Customary Courts Law as amended\nby the Customary Courts (Amendment) Law, 1959\nvests in the Board the power to appoint, dismiss\nand exercise disciplinary control, including\nsuspension of Presidents or Vice Presidents of\nCustomary Courts. It is the appointing authority for\nall members of a Customary Court.\nNo similar statutory duties have been vested in the\nNigerian Bar Association by any statute to be\nexercised by the Association. The obligation of\nnominating or electing its members into bodies\nestablished by law, or the automatic membership of\nits President in such bodies are not such statutory\n114\nduties.\nLike Thomas v. Local Government Service Board\n(supra) discussed, Kpebimoh's case involved the\nBoard of Governors, Western Ijaw Teachers'\nTraining College, a body established under Section\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n109/136\n53 of the Education Law, Cap.34. The instrument of\nManagement listed various functions which the\nBoard, though not incorporated, but established by\nlaw is empowered to discharge. It is therefore\nreasonable to imply that the Board in the discharge\nof these functions will exercise the rights of a legal\nperson and will if the nature of the duty discharged\nso involved, be suable in the courts, i.e. possess\njuristic personality. The General Council of the Bar,\nthe 5th Respondent in this appeal which is the body\nestablished under Section 1(1) of the Legal\nPractitioners Act 1975 is the body charged with the\ngeneral management of the affairs of the\nAssociation, the first Respondent. This is\ncomparable to the position of the Association of\nUniversities of the British Commonwealth in\nrelation to its National Council on Admissions in\nWillis v. Association of Universities of the British\nCommonwealth (supra).\nThe decision of the High Court of Australia in the\ncase of Chaff and Hay Acquisition Committee & Ors.\nv. J. A. Hemphill & Sons Proprietary Ltd. (1946-47)\n74 C.L.R. 375 is a valid illustration of ascription of\nlegal personality by implication. The Chaff and Hay\nCommittee was a statutory body created under the\nChaff and Hay (Acquisition) Act 1944 (S.A.). The\nCommittee of four established by S.3 was\n115\nauthorised inter alia, to acquire within and without\nthe state certain property, which on acquisition, it\nheld in its collective name, Sections 4,5(1),8. It was\nalso empowered to dispose of property and to sue\nin its collective name Section 14(1). The Act\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n110/136\ncontained no express words of incorporation and\nthe committee had no common seal. It was\ncontended that the Committee was not a legal\nentity, having not been incorporated. The appellant\nconceded among other submissions that the\ncommittee possessed all the characteristics of a\ncorporation with the exception of the words of\nincorporation and the attributes of a perpetual\nsuccession and common seal. These it was argued\nwere vital and fatal.\nThe words of the enabling provisions clearly showed\nthat the property and rights acquired and liabilities\nincurred by the Committee were those of the\nCommittee and not of the members. Accordingly, it\nwas held that the Committee is a legal entity in\nSouth Australia distinct from the persons\ncomposing it from time to time, with the property,\nrights and liabilities belonging to it and not to those\npersons.\nLegal personality can only be conferred by statute.\nIt may be conferred for a limited purpose as was\ndone in respect of the Minister of Health in\nEngland, to acquire and hold land - Gilleghan v.\nMinister of Health (1932) 1 K.B. 86. This seems to\nme a notion of qualified personality which Fullagar,\nJ. in Williams v. Hursey (1960) 103 C.L.R. 30 at p.\n52 regards as unintelligible. I do not share the\n116\nopinion. It is clearly not inconsistent with the\npossession of legal personality that the capacity of\nthe persona should be limited.\nThe most fundamental of the differences between a\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n111/136\ncorporation and an unincorporated association are\nthat the corporation has \"perpetual succession,\" it\nmaintains its identity and its personality,\nnotwithstanding changes in its membership; its\nproperty does not belong to its members. But the\nproperty of an unincorporated association does\nbelong to its members from time to time, and that\nproperty may be owned by entirely different\npersons at the date when the cause of action arose,\nat the date when the action is commenced, and at\nthe date when the judgment is pronounced. The\ncases I have considered are sufficient for the\npurposes of this judgment. I intend no disrespect\nfor not considering the other cases to which we\nwere referred.\nIt seems to me that the Association cannot by\nimplication from the exercise of any functions\nimposed on it by statute enjoy the attributes of\njuristic personality acquired only upon\nincorporation. The Court of Appeal was accordingly\nright when it held as follows:\n\"The true position appears to me to be that the law\nrecognises an association such as the first appellant\nas a separate entity for a variety of purposes but\nnot for the purposes of suing or being sued in its\nown name.\"\nI agree with this conclusion as\naccurately representing the correct legal position.\nSince the declaration sought is against the\n117\nAssociation, against whom an action cannot be\nbrought in its own name, the Court of Appeal came\nto the correct decision by striking out its name from\nthe summons. Authority for the principle which are\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n112/136\nwell settled can be found in Agbonmagbe Bank Ltd.\nv. General Manager, G. B. Ollivant Ltd . (1961)All\nN.L.R. 116; Martins v. Federal Administrator\nGeneral and Anor (1963) L. L. R. 65. I also agree\nwith the judgment of the Court of Appeal, that the\neffective Defendant, against whom any claim is\nmade in the action is the Nigerian Bar Association.\nIt is obvious from the Statement of Claim of tile\nplaintiff, that he has no claim against the General\nCouncil of the Bar, the 2nd Defendant in the action.\nIt follows therefore that since the only effective\nDefendant is not a juristic person there is no\nDefendant before the court to answer the\ndeclarations sought.

The appeal can be\ndetermined on this ground alone. I shall rest my\njudgment on these grounds alone whilst I agree\n118\nwith and adopt opinion expressed on the other\ngrounds by my learned brother, Agbaje, J.S.C.\nFor the reasons I have given above, I hereby\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n113/136\ndismiss the appeal of the appellant with N500 as\ncosts to each set of Respondents.\nSAIDU KAWU, J.S.C.: I have had the advantage of\nreading in draft the lead judgment of my learned\nbrother, Agbaje, J .S.C. which had just been\ndelivered. I am in complete agreement with his\nreasoning and his conclusion that the appeal is\ndevoid of merit and should be dismissed.\nThe only aspect of this case on which I would like to\ncomment is that relating to the order of injunction\nmade by the learned trial Chief Judge restraining\nthe 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents from appearing\nfor the 1st Respondent on the ground that they had\n\"breached their duties to the administration of\njustice.\" On the facts before the learned trial Chief\nJudge and all the surrounding circumstances, I am\nof the firm view that there was no justification\nwhatsoever for making that order of injunction, and\nthat the Court of Appeal was right in setting it\naside. It is for this reason and for the fuller reasons\ncontained in the judgment of my learned brother,\nAgbaje, J.S.C. that I too will dismiss the appeal. I\nabide by all the orders made in the lead judgment\nincluding orders as to costs.\nCHUKWUDIFU AKUNNE OPUTA, J.S.C.: I have\nhad the privilege of a preview in draft of the\nmarathon judgment just\n119\ndelivered by my noble and learned brother, Agbaje,\nJ.S.C. His examination and treatment of the various\nStatutes, Decrees, Acts and subsidiary legislations\nmentioned in the long but erudite Brief of the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n114/136\nappellant was rather exhaustive. His consideration\nof the various legal issues raised in the equally\nbrilliant Briefs filed by the Respondents was\ncomprehensive. That being so, one is naturally\ntempted to say \"I concur, I have nothing else to\nadd.\" But the Personality Conception of legal entity\nis so important to procedural law that one is obliged\nto make some contribution, no matter how small to\nthe debate on the issue.\nHow did it all arise? The Plaintiff now Appellant\nsued the Nigerian Bar Association as 1st Defendant\nand the General Council of the Bar as 2nd\nDefendant by an Originating Summons claiming\ntwo Declarations. After the break-down of\nnegotiations for reconciliation, spearheaded by no\nless a legal giant than Sir Adetokunbo Ademola, the\nfirst indigenous Chief Justice of this country, to\nhave this dispute concerning our learned and\nhonorable profession settled in a learned and\nhonorable way, in the interest of the dignity and\nintegrity of the profession, irrespective of who was\nright and who was wrong; after this, three Senior\nAdvocates of Nigeria, Chief F.R.A. Williams, S.A.N.,\nMr. E. A. Molajo, S.A.N. and Mr. Kehinde Sofola,\nS.A.N., who incidentally were also invited to the\nabortive reconciliation exercise, appeared for the\n1st Defendant - the Nigerian Bar Association. They\nwere not parties to the dispute. They merely\n120\nappeared as counsel to the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation, and that is why I referred to them in\nthe title as Respondents only and not as\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n115/136\nDefendants/Respondents. Only the 1st and the 5th\nI referred to as Defendants/Respondents\nrespectively. The appearance of the 3 Senior\nAdvocates for the Nigerian Bar Association seems\nto have widened the area of controversy. Pursuant\nto that appearance, two motions were filed:\n1. One by the plaintiff/appellant brought under the\nInherent Jurisdiction of the Court for \"an Order of\nthe Interlocutory Injunction restraining Chief for R.\nA. Williams, S.A.N., Mr. Kehinde Sofola, S.A.N. and\nMr. E. A. Molajo, S.A.N., from acting or from\ncontinuing to act or from representing or from\ncontinuing to represent the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation, the 1st Defendant in this suit on the\nground that their appearance or representation for\nthe Nigerian Bar Association is improper,\nunprofessional, dishonourable and dishonest\" (see\np. 147 of the record).\n2. The second motion brought by Chief Williams for\nthe 1st Defendant, was for \"an order:\n(a) striking out the name of the 1st Defendant on\nthe ground that it is not a juristic person and so\ncannot be sued;\n(b) striking out the entire action on the ground that\neven if all the facts pleaded in the Statement of\nClaim are admitted or established, the Court will\nnot grant any of the reliefs claimed in the absence\nof all the proper parties to the action.\" (see p. 164\nof the record)\nIn his Ruling on the two motions set\n121\nout above, the learned trial Chief Judge of Lagos\nState held inter alia:\n\"1. \"That the Nigerian Bar Association, the 1st\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n116/136\nDefendant is a juristic person and that it was\nproperly sued by the applicant as a Defendant in\nthis suit (see p. 192 lines 25-28).\n2. The motion. . . praying the Court to strike out\nthe entire action is in my considered view\nmisconceived and is accordingly dismissed (see p.\n192 lines 29-32).\n3. On the prevailing facts of the present situation\nand in exercise therefore of the Court's inherent\nJurisdiction and in spite of the misconceived basis\nupon which the applicant has founded his motion\nthe Court is able and thus therefore modify the\norder prayed for, for an interlocutory injunction to\nan order of injunction simplicity. The three learned\nSenior Advocates of Nigeria, Chief Williams, Mr.\nKehinde Sofola, and Mr. Malojo, are therefore\nhereby restrained from further appearance for any\nof the parties, in this case as presently\nconstituted\" (see p. 199 lines 26-35 and p. 200\nline 1).\nThe trial Chief Judge thus resolved all the issues\narising in the two motions in favour of the plaintiff.\nHe also allowed the 3 Senior Advocates to appeal\nagainst his order of injunction made against them.\nObviously and apparently dissatisfied and\naggrieved, the 1st Defendant the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation, and the 3 Senior Advocates of Nigeria\nappealed against the Ruling of the learned Chief\nJudge to the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division, coram\n122\nNnaemeka-Aku, Kutigi and Kolawole, H.C.A.

(2) The plaintiff has waived\nall objections which could have taken to the\nappearance of the three Senior Advocates of\nNigeria.\n(3) The evidence of what took place at the\nresidence of Sir Adetokunbo Ademola was\ninadmissable at the hearing of the plaintiff's\napplication.\n(4) The learned Chief Judge was in error in\nexpressing the opinion that the three Senior\nAdvocates had \"breached their duties to the\nadministration of Justice.\"\n(5) There was absoluely no ground for\nmaking an order for injunction against the three\nSenior advocates.\"\nThe appeals of the 1st Defendant, the Nigerian\nBar Association and of the three Senior Advocates\nthus succeeded in their entirety.\nIt definitely does look like legal quibbling to hold in\none breath that the Nigerian Bar Association is not\na juristic person, not a legal persona, and in\nanother breath to sanction that that non-existent\nlegal entity can be represented by counsel and can\nsuccessfully prosecute an appeal. And therein lies\nthe complexities of the legal personality concept.\nNo one is doubting that the Nigerian Bar\n123\nAssociation is not an entity. It is definitely a\ncollection of all the legal practitioners compelled by\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n118/136\nlaw to become its members. Chief Gani Fawehinmi\nthus referred to the Nigerian Bar Association as an\n\"involuntary association\" of lawyers. Chief Williams\nin his Brief put the issue correctly thus:\n\"The issue is simply whether or not the N.B.A. has\ncapacity to sue or to be sued eo nomine i.e. in its\nown name. This is the same thing as the question\nwhether or not the N.B.A. is a \"juristic person\" or\nwhether or not it is a \"legal person.\" It is very\nimportant to emphasise that the case for these\nRespondents is not that the N.B.A. cannot sue or be\nsued. The Respondent's case is that the N.B.A. can\nonly sue or be sued by the representative action\nprocedure prescribed by the Rules of the Court and\nnever in its own name\" . . . By way of illustration,\nreference may be made to the portion of the\njudgment where the learned Chief Judge referred\nto the fact that under Section 7(4)(c) of the Legal\nPractitioners Act, 1975, the N.B.A. is entitled to\nreceive three quarters of the aggregate amount of\nthe practising fees collected from all Practitioners\nby the registrar. He then posed the question:\n\"Can one doubt the right of the Association to\ninstitute a claim for the recovery of such sum if it is\nnot paid over to it by the Registrar?\"\nThe question shows a misconception of the\nRespondent's case. It does not reflect the fact that\nboth parties would answer that question in the\naffirmative and that the only dispute between them\nis whether the N.B.A. should bring such claim in its\n124\nown name (as the plaintiff contends) or by the\nrepresentative action procedure prescribed by the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n119/136\nrules of Court (as the Defendants contend)\".\nIt is therefore common ground that the Nigerian\nBar Association can sue and can be sued. The only\ndispute is, will it sue eo nomine because it is a legal\npersona OR will it sue by a representative action\nprocedure because it is merely a collection of\nindividuals with no separate legal existence of its\nown?\nNow if the Nigerian Bar Association has legal\npersonality then it can sue eo nomine. If it has no\nlegal personality then it can only sue by a\nrepresentative action for it certainly is a body or an\nassociation consisting of many members (many\nhuman beings).\nThere is no doubt that a human being is a person in\nthe eyes of the law - to use the Latin alternative a\n\"persona.\" Law in this regard takes account of\nhuman beings so far as their jural relations are\ninvolved. This in Roman law meant the power to\nsue as well the power to own property. English law\ntook over the popular reference of the word\n\"person\" to human beings as its point of reference,\nas well as its starting point. It gradually extended\nthe term \"person\" to include artificial entities like\ncorporations. Now what and what are common to a\nhuman being and a corporation? Each is a unit of\njural relations. The concern of the law is to\norganise masses of jural relationships whether\ncentred on an individual or a group. In\njurisprudence therefore a \"person\" is capable of\n125\nhaving rights and of being liable to duties in\ncontradistinction to a \"thing\" which is always the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n120/136\nsubject of rights and duties. Now the legal concept\nof a human being is simply a multitude of claims,\nduties, liberties etc. treated as a unit. If therefore\nthe law invests an artificial entity like corporation\nwith a \"multitude of claims, duties, liberties, etc.\" it\nlikewise invests it with the status of a legal person\nor a persona. There is therefore no distinction in\nlaw between a \"natural\" and \"legal person.\" Both\nare legal personae and each is legal persona. The\nposition then is that legal personality is an artificial\ncreation of the law. It should be obvious that not all\nhuman beings possess full legal personality. Thus\ninfants, lunatics and idiots possess but a \"restricted\nlegal personality\" hence some sue by their next\nfriends, others by their guardians.\nSince the law is the sole grantor of legal\npersonality, in any given case, the issue will be -\nhas the law granted legal personality to the body\nunder discussion here, the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation? Starting from the known to the\nunknown, one quickly finds that in addition to\nhuman beings the law created artificial persons:\n(i) The development of trade had enlarged the\ngrouping of jural relations in such a way as to\nembrace collections of individuals organised in what\nis known as a corporation aggregate. Incorporated\nbodies like companies are thus persons under the\nlaw. The Nigerian Bar Association is definitely not a\ncompany.\n(ii) The Corporation sole like the Bishop of a\n126\ndiocese with perpetual succession has been\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n121/136\ninvested with legal personality by the law. The\nNigerian Bar Association is not a Corporation Sole.\n(iii) Certain unincorporated associations have been\ngranted the status of legal person by the law:\n(a) Registered trade unions have the power granted\nthem by the law to bring actions eo nomine:\nNational Union of General and Municipal Workers v.\nGillian (1946) K.B. 81; (1945) 2 All E.R. 593;\nBritish Motor Trade Association v. Salvadori (1949)\nCh. 556; (1949) 1 All E.R. 208; Taff Vale Rail Co.\nv. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants\n(1901) A.C. 426.\nIn this case, it is not contended that the N.B.A. is a\ntrade union and I dare say it will be derogatory to\nthe honour and dignity of the Bar to regard the\nN.B.A. as a trade union. A trade union has some of\nthe essential characteristics of a legal person\nincluding the power to sue and be sued given to it\nby law. Thus, in Bonsor v. Musicians' Union (1956)\nA.C. 104: (1955) 3 All E.R. 518 the House of Lords\nheld that a member can sue a trade union as a\nlegal entity for breach of contract.\n(b) Partnerships - By the Partnership Act 1890 S.\n24(2) a firm can sue and be sued in its own name.\nThe Nigerian Bar Association is not a partnership.\n(c) Friendly Societies - There are special statutory\nprovisions by which these societies can sue and be\nsued in their registered names. Now a friendly\nsociety is a voluntary association formed for the\npurpose of raising, by subscription of members,\nfunds out of which advances may be made for the\n127\nmutual relief and the maintenance of the members\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n122/136\nand their families in sickness, infancy, old age or\ninfirmity. The N.B.A. is definitely not a friendly\nsociety inspite of that fraternity for which the Bar is\nnoted. Also as Chief Gani Fawehinmi himself\npointed out the N.B.A. far from being a voluntary\nassociation is an \"involuntary association\" for by\nSection 2 of the Legal Practitioners Act, 1975,\nmembership is not optional, it is not voluntary, it is\nimperative and involuntary.\nHaving above surveyed the principal and usual\njural units to which the law ascribes legal\npersonality namely:\n(i) Human beings;\n(ii) Companies incorporated under the various\nCompanies Acts;\n(iii) Corporation sole with perpetual succession;\n(iv) Trade Unions;\n(v) Partnerships; and\n(vi) Friendly societies;\nand having found that the N.B .A. cannot easily be\nfitted into any of the above jural units, one then\nstarts to wonder the quo warranto by which the\nN.B.A. was constituted a jural unit and invested by\nlaw with legal personality.\nOur problem is to find which law, if any, created\nthe N.B.A., conferred on it rights and duties, and\nprescribed penalties for breaches of those rights\nand duties. All these form the contents of those\njural relationships which will inevitably lead to the\ninference that legal personality has been conferred\non a jural unit. Because of the necessities and\n128\nexigencies of modern commerce and business, the\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n123/136\nlaw wisely treated corporations, trade unions,\npartnership etc. as legal persons. \"If the law allows\nmen to form permanently organised groups\" wrote\nMaitland (in his Collected Papers 111, 314) \"those\ngroups will be for common opinion, right and duty\nbearing units; and if the law giver will not openly\ntreat them as such he will misrepresent or as the\nFrench say, he will 'denature' the facts; in other\nwords, he will make a mess and call it law.\" In this\nparticular case, has the law allowed lawyers to form\nthe Nigerian Bar Association as a permanently\norganised association of lawyers? The answer here\nseems to be yes. Then we come to stage 2. Is the\nassociation, the Nigerian Bar Association, a right\nand duty bearing unit? That is the crux of the\nmatter. Chief Gani Fawehinmi has studiously and\nmeticulously set out nearly all the laws ever\nenacted relating to the N.B.A. One has now to\nexamine those laws closely to find out whether\nanyone of them or a combination of some of them,\nconferred rights and imposed duties on the N.B.A.\nin relation with the plaintiff such that unless legal\npersonality is ascribed to the N.B.A. an injustice to\nthe plaintiff/appellant might result: Thomas v. Local\nGovernment Service Board (1965) 1 All N.L.R. 168\npp. 171/172 refers. Both sides relied on Thomas v.\nLocal Government Service Board supra and I am\nglad they did because that case is crucial to a right\ndetermination of the central issue in this appeal.\nHowever, Patton in his Jurisprudence 2nd ed. pp.\n334/335 warned:\n129\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n124/136\n\"But it can hardly be claimed that legal personality\nshould be automatically achieved as soon as a\ngroup develops a certain stage of organisation - if\nonly for convenience, the law demands compliance\nwith certain formalities as a condition of the grant\nof legal personality.\"\nThis has to be so because legal personality as a\nlegal concept pre-supposes the corpus - here the\nN.B .A. - into which the law infuses the animus of a\nfictitious personality. Legal personality is not\nreached until the law recognises, over and above\nthe associated individuals a single entity which in a\nmanner represents them, but is not identical with\nthem. As I observed earlier on legal persons are\narbitary creations of the law.\nWhat law credited the N.B.A.? Chief Fawehinmi\nreferred to the Constitution, Standing Orders, and\nBye Laws of the Nigerian Bar Association copied at\npp. 17 to 42. Without taking isue on whether that\nConstitution is or is not a subsidiary legislation, it is\nmy humble view that a body has, first of all, to\ncome into existence before it can talk of having a\nconstitution, standing orders and bye laws. These\nare or should be extrinsic to the body itself. These -\nconstitution, standing orders, bye laws - prove that\nthe N.B.A. has developed an appreciable stage of\norganisation. Now what law created the N.B.A.\nbefore it was able to give itself a constitution? That\nis the question. Statutory creation of a jural unit\ninto a legal persona should be an act easily\nreferable to one particular statute, for once a unit\nis thus created a legal persona it acquires that\n130\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n125/136\nstatus and retains it until the law says or acts\notherwise. I therefore agree with the remarks in\nthe opinion expressed by the St. Louis Court of\nAppeal in Forest City Manufacturing Co. & Ors. v.\nGarment Workers Union 223 M.a. App. 935 at p.\n943 cited by Nnaemeka-Agu, J .C.A. (as he then\nwas) at p. 394 of the record that:\n\"It is inconceivable to think that one desiring to\nlearn if a particular association has been\nconstituted a suable entity should be put to the\ntask of leafing meticulously through the pages of\nthe statutes and subsequent session acts to see per\nchance if that association had somewhere and\nsometime been accorded a privilege of any\ncharacter not accorded to individuals or\npartnerships and it is equally inconceivable to think\nthat the Legislature, if it had ever desired to\nconstitute a voluntary unincorporated association a\nsuable entity, would have done so by the strained\nand indirect method contended by the Respondent,\nthat is, by exempting it from the income tax laws,\nor by giving it the right to select a union label,\ndetermine where the same should be displayed, or\nby giving it the right to be represented by a\nmember on the State Board of Mediation.\"\nIn other words not all privileges granted to an\nassociation unincorporated will lead to an inference\nthat legal personality was thus being granted.\nThere must exist generally a right and duty\nrelationship before legal personality will be implied.\nThe court is grateful to Chief Williams for making\navailable to it Photostat copies of the full report to\n131\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n126/136\nthe Forest City Manufacturing Co's case.\nIt does not take more than one stature, in fact one\nSection of the Statute, to invest legal personality\non an unincorporated association. If it is not\npossible to find that solitary statute, then the\ninevitable inference is that the association has not\nbeen granted juristic personality by the law. Thus\nSection 1 of the Legal Practitioners Decree (now\nAct) 1975 in clear unambiguous language created\nan artificial unit called the General Council of the\nBar - the 5th Defendant/Respondent in this case.\nThe same cannot be said of the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation. Tracing all the Statutes from 1933 to\n1979, which recognised the N.B.A, is to my mind\nbegging the question. The issue is which particular\nStatute created the N.B.A. a legal persona? Which\nstatute made the N.B.A. a suable entity? Which\nstatute created the N.B.A. a jural unit with rights\nand duties relationship generally or at least with\nthe plaintiff/appellant which will compel the Courts\nin the interest of justice to hold that injustice will\noccur to the plaintiff/appellant unless the\nassociation is held to be suable eo nomine? These\nare the relevant questions pleading for appropriate\nanswers. The argument that the N.B.A. is\nrecognised by many statutes, Acts or enactments is\nnot the answer for the word \"recognise\" is not\nunivocal, that is, specifically referable to a\nrecognition of its juristic personality. On the\ncontrary, it is equivocal and may properly be\nreferable to any of the many aspects of the\norganisation. For instance, what was it in the\n132\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n127/136\nN.B.A. that these enactments recognised - is it the\nname N.B.A. or the fact that there is an association\nof lawyers known as and called the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation. For that body to acquire the status of\n\"an artificial person\" known to the law, it has either\nto be incorporated, or the self same law will clearly\nand unequivocally invest it with juristic personality.\nNo enactment cited by Chief Gani Fawehinmi has\ngone that far.\nIt is true that Section 7(4)(c) of the Legal\nPractitioners Decree No. 15 of 1975 imposed an\nobligation on the Registrar to pay over to the\nN.B.A. 9/10 of the aggregate amount of practising\nfees received by him from lawyers, and that the\nN.B.A. should keep audited account of all such\nmonies received. It is also true that the N.B.A. is\nrequired by Section 9(2)(c) of Act No. 15 of 1975 to\nnominate twelve practitioners to the Legal\nPractitioners Disciplinary Committee. The N.B.A.\nalso nominates some of its members to the Body of\nBenchers. All these are conceded. But these are not\nthe type of jural relationships required to lead to an\nirresistible conclusion that the law intended to\ncreate or constitute the N.B.A. into a juristic\nperson. But why should one go through this\ncircuitous route whereas the law, if it wanted, could\nsimply have said \"There shall be created a\nconstituted body known as the N.B.A.\" It is as\nsimple as that. The inevitable conclusion that one is\nforced to arrive at is that the N.B.A. is an\nunincorporated body of persons. Such a body is not\nbereft of rights and remedies. The problem of how\n133\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n128/136\nto adapt legal proceedings to unincorporated\nsocieties or associations consisting of many\nmembers is by no means new. These have to\nproceed by a representative action procedure. Chief\nWilliams admits and concedes this much. In other\nwords, the Plaintiff/Appellant can still press his\nclaim but by a representative action procedure. My\nanswer to the question:\n\"Whether the Nigerian Bar Association is a juristic\nperson capable of suing and being sued in its\nname?\"\nIs No. It is not. Being an unincorporated\nassociation, it has to sue or be sued by and in a\nrepresentative action procedure. It has the corpus -\nthe de facto association - but the law has not\ninfused into the corpus the animus of legal\npersonality. It is a juridical entity but it has not yet\nacquired a juristic personality.\nI will now review some of the decided cases cited to\nshow that the N.B.A. although unincorporated\nshould be regarded as having been impliedly\ngranted a legal personality. Both sides cited and\nrelied on Chief Andrew Thomas v. Local\nGovernment Service Board (1965) 1 All N.L.R. 168.\nIn this case, the Board was sued. It was the\ncontention of the Board that it was not a suable\nentity. The Local Government Service Board was\ncreated and established (not just recognised) by\nthe Local Government Law of the Western Region\nof Nigeria. The Board has to discharge certain\nfunctions under the law. The law creating the Board\nmade no provisions regarding whether it may sue\n134\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n129/136\nor be sued or whether it could own property. I dare\nsay these are some of the indicia of legal\npersonality. This Court in the peculiar\ncircumstances of Thomas' case including the fact\nthat the Board was created by statute for the\ndischarge of particular public functions held at pp.\n171/172:\n\"We reject the submission that a statutory body\nwith functions like those of the Local Government\nService is not liable to be sued for a declaration\nand we do so more readily since the statutory\nprovisions relating to the appellant's office are such\nthat injustice might result if the Board could not be\nmade a Defendant to any kind of proceedings. . . so\nfar as the Board is concerned we are of the opinion\nthat the Customary Court Law impliedly confers on\nit the right to be a party to an action for\ndeclaration. . .\" (the italics are mine).\nIt is clear in Thomas' case above that it was the\nCourt itself, in the exercise of its interpretative\njurisdiction, that ascribed to the Board some of the\nelements of legal personality namely the power to\nsue or be sued. This sums to confirm the dicta in\nBonsor v. Musicians' Union (1956) A.C. 104 at pp.\n144 & 157 that the categories of legal personae are\nnot closed. More and more entities will definitely be\nbrought in, at least, by the Courts, if the justice of\nthe case so dictates. The question now arises - Is\nthe present case on all fours with Thomas' case\nsupra?\nThe learned trial Chief Judge at p. 186 lines 26-35\nand p. 187 lines 1 and 2 of the record reproduced\n135\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n130/136\nthe same portion of the Supreme Court's judgment\nin Thomas' case supra that I set out above. Chief\nGani Fawehinmi in his Brief dealt with the same\ncase at pp. 17 to 19 and also reproduced that very\nsame portion of the judgment in Thomas v. Local\nGovernment Board supra. But with respect, the\nlearned Chief Judge and Chief Gani Fawehinmi did\nnot draw the necessary distinction between the\ncase now on appeal and Thomas' case namely:\n(i) In Thomas' case the Local Government Board\nwas created by Statute the Customary Court Law.\nIn the case on appeal no particular Statute has\nbeen identified as the one that created the N .B.A.\nAll the available submission is that many\nenactments recognised the existence of the N.B.A.\n(ii) The Board in Thomas' case had and was charged\nwith the discharge of public functions. That the\nN.B.A. collects a percentage of practising fees from\nthe Registrar and appoints or nominates members\nto the Disciplinary Committee or to the Body of\nBenchers, I will regard as \"private domestic\nfunction\" relating only to the legal profession.\nThese do not affect the public at large.\n(iii) This Court was forced to the conclusion (in\nThomas' case) quoted by the learned Chief Judge\nand by Chief Gani Fawehinmi because the statutory\nprovisions and obligations imposed on the Board\nrelated to \"the appellant's office.\" There was thus a\nnexus between the statutory functions of the Board\nand the injury complained of by the appellant in\nthat case. I can see no such nexus between the\nduty to collect 9/10 of practising fees from the\n136\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n131/136\nregistrar, the right or privilege to nominate\nmembers to the Disciplinary Committee and to the\nBody of Benchers and the Declarations sought by\nthe Plaintiff/Appellant in this case.\nThe facts of Thomas' case and the case now on\nappeal are different. And it is the facts of any\nparticular case that will frame the issues for\ndecision. The portion of the judgment in Thomas'\ncase supra which I reproduced above (and which\nthe trial Chief Judge and Chief Gani Fawehinmi\nrelied upon) cannot without violence to the facts of\nthe present case be comfortably applied to this\ncase. To do so will be to misapply the principle of\nthe decision in Thomas v. Local Government Board\nsupra - or to apply the principle out of its proper\ncontext.\nThe next case relied upon by Chief Gani Fawehinmi\nwas William kpebimoh v. The Board of Governors\nWestern Ijaw Teachers' Training College (1966) 1\nN.M.L.R. 130. This is a High Court decision. All the\nsame, it expresses beautifully the point made by\nthis Court in Thomas v. Local Government Board\nsupra. In fact the presiding Judge, Arthur Prest, J.\nrelied on Thomas' case supra and on the House of\nLords' decision in Taff Vale Rail Co. v. Amalgamated\nSociety of Railway Servants (1901) A.C. 426. Again\nthe facts of Kpebimoh's case supra that led to the\ndecision quoted by Chief Gani Fawehinmi at p. 19\nof his Brief were that:\n(i) The Board was a creature of Statute - the\nEducation Law of Western Nigeria (applicable to\nMid-Western Nigeria).\n137\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n132/136\n(ii) The Board has statutory functions the\nmanagement of educational institutions.\n(iii) The law establishing the Board did not\nspecifically give it the right to sue or be sued.\n(iv) The plaintiff complained of the breach of his\ncontract with the Board\nby the Board. .\nIn the above circumstances, Arthur Prest,\nJ. held, rightly in my view, that:\n(i) An unincorporated body which is empowered by\nthe Legislature to do certain things which can result\nin injury to others must be taken to have impliedly\nthe power to sue or be sued.\n(ii) Having regard to the statutory functions of the\nDefendant/Board, though it is not an incorporated\nbody, it is capable of being sued as a legal entity\ndistinct from its members.\nThe ratio decidendi of the above case quoted in p.\n19 of Chief Gani Fawehinmi's Brief will apply to the\ncase now on appeal if and only if the facts of the\ntwo cases are the same or similar. But they are\nnot. The N.B.A. was not created by any Stature.\nThe functions it has (even if they can be called\nstatutory) namely to receive a percentage of\npractising fees from the registrar, to nominate\nmembers to the Disciplinary Committee and to the\nBody of Benchers are not the subject of the present\ncontroversy. Any injury the plaintiff/appellant\nalleges he suffered was not inflicted by the N.B.A.\nin exercise of any of its statutory functions above\nmentioned. That seems to be the rationale of the\ndecision in Thomas and Kpebimoh supra.\n138\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n133/136\nIt is good to call the Court's attention to its\npronouncements in a previous case. Under our\nsystem (which we inherited from England and from\nthe common law) the formulation of general\nprinciples has not preceded decisions. Our case law\nis the law of the practitioner rather than the law of\nthe philosopher. Decisions have drawn their\ninspiration and their strength from the very facts\nwhich framed the issues for decision. Once made,\nthese decisions control future judgments of the\nCourts in like or similar cases. The facts of two\ncases must be either the same or at least similar\nbefore the decision in one can be used and even\nthere as a guide to the decision in another case.\nWhat the former decision establishes is only a\nprinciple not a rule. Rules operate in an all or\nnothing dimension. Principles do not. They merely\nform a principium, a starting point. Where one\nultimately lands will then depend on the peculiar\nfacts and circumstances of the case in hand. I will\nsay the same for all the other cases cited in the\nappellant's Brief.\nIt is clear from the declarations claimed that the\nreal Defendant in this case was the Nigerian Bar\nAssociation. Nothing has really been claimed\nagainst the General Council of the Bar. If the real\nsubstantial Defendant, the N.B.A., is struck out as\nnot being a suable legal entity, that will be the end\nof the proceedings. The Court of Appeal was\ntherefore right in dismissing the Plaintiff/Appellant's\naction in limine.\nIn the final result and for the reasons given above\n139\n5/8/25, 11:11 AM\nabout:blank\nabout:blank\n134/136\nand for the fuller reasons in the lead judgment of\nmy learned brother, Agbaje, J.S.C., which I now\nadopt as mine, I, too, will dismiss this appeal.
